      <description>Remote Sensing and Earth Observation     With the co-development of 52Â° North (Germany), the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) developed the toolbox for the European Space Agency (ESA) according to the needs of the NDVI time series analysis community.
The focus of this project was the implementation of a time series analysis toolbox for remote sensing imagery, specifically for Proba-V data, in R. The mission exploitation platform (MEP) at VITO (Flemish Institute for Technological Research NV, Belgium) derives the data from their Proba-V satellite.</description>

      <description>QUICS was an EU funded FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) which ran for 4 years, starting in 2014.      The Ph.D. journey started     Since January 2015 I began my Ph.D. research and made part of the QUICS project. The overall aim of QUICS was to provide high-level training and to research the further implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), improving water quality management by assessing the uncertainty of integrated catchment model water quality predictions.</description>
