      <description>Remote Sensing and Earth Observation     With the co-development of 52° North (Germany), the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) developed the toolbox for the European Space Agency (ESA) according to the needs of the NDVI time series analysis community.
The focus of this project was the implementation of a time series analysis toolbox for remote sensing imagery, specifically for Proba-V data, in R. The mission exploitation platform (MEP) at VITO (Flemish Institute for Technological Research NV, Belgium) derives the data from their Proba-V satellite.</description>
