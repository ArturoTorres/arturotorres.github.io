Abstract = {John Desmond Bernal (1901-1970) was one of the most eminent scientists
   in molecular biology and is also regarded as the founding father of the
   science of science. His book The social function of science laid the
   theoretical foundations for the discipline. In this article, we
   summarize four chief characteristics of his ideas in the science of
   science: the sociohistorical perspective, theoretical models,
   qualitative and quantitative approaches, and studies of science planning
   and policy. China has constantly reformed its scientific and
   technological system based on research evidence of the science of
   science. Therefore, we analyze the impact of Bernal's science-of-science
   thoughts on the development of China's science of science, and discuss
   how they might be usefully taken still further in quantitative studies
   of science.},

Abstract = {A new approach of general systems theory is used to study the
   feasibility of the definition of the theory so-called the science of
   science.  General scientific theory is studied as a system.  The
   technique, well used by Bertrand Russell in his famous Russell paradox,
   is applied to show that the theory of science of science cannot exist. 
   A new definition of the theory of science of science is given, so that
   paradoxes similar to Russell's paradox will not occur in the new theory
   of science of science developed on the new definition.},

Abstract = {Nalimov's relations with Polish scientists date from the sixties. He was
   present in Polish science owing to his publication - also specially
   prepared for Polish journals - and for his participation in
   Polish-Soviet science of science conferences organized alternately in
   Poland and in (of that time) Soviet Union. He had a high opinion - which
   he many times expressed - on contemporary condition of Polish science of
   science as well as on its previous achievements. In such opinion he was
   riot isolated; also John Bernal and Derek de Solla Price referred in
   their papers to precursory statements of Maria and Stanislaw Ossowski
   formulating already in the thirties of XX century progressive programme
   for science of science research. Ten years earlier a similar views upon
   science presented world-famous Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki. So,
   in the first part of the paper a common way of thinking and approaching
   science of science basic problems in Ossowski's, Znaniecki's and
   Nalimov's works is presented. In the second part the direct contacts of
   Nalimov with Polish science of science researchers widely described and
   commentated in Polish journals are discussed. At least using citation
   analysis the influence of Nalimov's ideas on science of science and
   scientometrics in Poland is presented. As a base to citation analysis
   the journal Problems of the Science of Science (1965-1999) and
   monographs devoted to scientometrics, bibliometrics and informetrics
   were taken.},

Title = {Regression discontinuity design and its applications to Science of
   Science: A survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 21},
Abstract = {Purpose: With the availability of large-scale scholarly datasets,
   scientists from various domains hope to understand the underlying
   mechanisms behind science, forming a vibrant area of inquiry in the
   emerging ``science of science{''} field. As the results from the science
   of science often has strong policy implications, understanding the
   causal relationships between variables becomes prominent. However, the
   most credible quasi-experimental method among all causal inference
   methods, and a highly valuable tool in the empirical toolkit, Regression
   Discontinuity Design (RDD) has not been fully exploited in the field of
   science of science. In this paper, we provide a systematic survey of the
   RDD method, and its practical applications in the science of
   science.Design/methodology/approach: First, we introduce the basic
   assumptions, mathematical notations, and two types of RDD, i.e., sharp
   and fuzzy RDD. Second, we use the Web of Science and the Microsoft
   Academic Graph datasets to study the evolution and citation patterns of
   RDD papers. Moreover, we provide a systematic survey of the applications
   of RDD methodologies in various scientific domains, as well as in the
   science of science. Finally, we demonstrate a case study to estimate the
   effect of Head Start Funding Proposals on child mortality.Findings: RDD
   was almost neglected for 30 years after it was first introduced in 1960.
   Afterward, scientists used mathematical and economic tools to develop
   the RDD methodology. After 2010, RDD methods showed strong applications
   in various domains, including medicine, psychology, political science
   and environmental science. However, we also notice that the RDD method
   has not been well developed in science of science research.Research
   Limitations: This work uses a keyword search to obtain RDD papers, which
   may neglect some related work. Additionally, our work does not aim to
   develop rigorous mathematical and technical details of RDD but rather
   focuses on its intuitions and applications.Practical implications: This
   work proposes how to use the RDD method in science of science
   research.Originality/value: This work systematically introduces the RDD,
   and calls for the awareness of using such a method in the field of
   science of science.},

Abstract = {Science of science has become a popular topic that attracts great
   attentions from the research community. The development of data
   analytics technologies and the readily available scholarly data enable
   the exploration of data-driven prediction, which plays a pivotal role in
   finding the trend of scientific impact. In this paper, we analyse
   methods and applications in data-driven prediction in the science of
   science, and discuss their significance. First, we introduce the
   background and review the current state of the science of science.
   Second, we review data-driven prediction based on paper citation count,
   and investigate research issues in this area. Then, we discuss methods
   to predict scholar impact, and we analyse different approaches to
   promote the scholarly collaboration in the collaboration network. This
   paper also discusses open issues and existing challenges, and suggests
   potential research directions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {SYSTEMS ANALYSIS MODELLING SIMULATION},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {221-226},
Abstract = {In this paper, the development of the concept of general systems is
   discussed.  A new model of general systems is given, which is a
   generalization, or say, a unified concept of all old definitions of
   general systems.  The new model of general systems is used to study the
   feasibility of the definition of the theory so-called the science of
   science.  General scientific theory is studied as a system.  The
   technique, well used by Bertrand Russell in his famous Russell paradox,
   is applied to show that the theory of science of science cannot exist. 
   A few philosophical problems are posed.  A new definition of the theory
   of science of science is given, so that paradoxes similar to Russell's
   paradox will not occur in the new theory of science of science developed
   on the new definition.},

Abstract = {Science of Science Policy has become a global agenda for academia and
   government. It is expected to offer intellectual and evidential basis
   for decision making about science and industrial policy. In this
   contribution, capability and competence of research on science of
   science policy is evaluated with bibliometric indicators. Scientific
   publications in models and tools for science of science policy,
   including econometrics, simulation, infometrics, data science, which was
   published by Japanese researchers, are analyzed. The capability and
   competence of Japanese think tanks are also evaluated and compared with
   those by U.S. think tanks. The results identified much room to be
   developed in a variety of sectors in academic research, public think
   tank, government, and education. Functions of each sector and
   collaborative approaches among them are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The desire to predict discoveries-to have some idea, in advance, of what
   will be discovered, by whom, when, and where-pervades nearly all aspects
   of modern science, from individual scientists to publishers, from
   funding agencies to hiring committees. In this Essay, we survey the
   emerging and interdisciplinary field of the ``science of science{''} and
   what it teaches us about the predictability of scientific discovery. We
   then discuss future opportunities for improving predictions derived from
   the science of science and its potential impact, positive and negative,
   on the scientific community.},

Abstract = {Clinical Science is proud to launch a new translational meta-research
   collection. Meta-research, or the science of science, applies the
   scientific method to study science itself. Meta-research is a powerful
   tool for identifying common problems in scientific papers, assessing
   their impact, and testing solutions to improve the transparency, rigor,
   trustworthiness, and usefulness of biomedical research. The collection
   welcomes science of science studies that link basic science to disease
   mechanisms, as well as meta-research articles highlighting opportunities
   to improve transparency, rigor, and reproducibility among the types of
   papers published in Clinical Science. Submissions might include science
   of science studies that explore factors linked to successful
   translation, or meta-research on experimental methods or study designs
   that are often used in translational research. We hope that this
   collection will encourage scientists to think critically about current
   practices and take advantage of opportunities to make their own research
   more transparent, rigorous, and reproducible.},

Abstract = {Historically, science of science studies were/are performed by single
   investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data sets
   and analyses scales up, a ``Big Science{''} approach (Price, 1963) is
   required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary
   teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big
   science of science studies utilize ``big data{''}, i.e., large, complex,
   diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned
   by different stakeholders. They apply a systems science approach to
   uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws.
   They make available open data and open code in support of replication of
   results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education.
   This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed
   to support big science of science studies. The open access Scholarly
   Database (SDB) (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26
   million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open
   source Science of Science (Sci2) tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports
   temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of
   the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses
   scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the
   geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth. The number of edges rather
   than nodes determined performance for network based algorithms.},

Abstract = {During the past two decades the availability of scholarly data
   repositories such as Google Scholar, Elsevier Scopus offered tremendous
   opportunities to the field of scientometrics to analyze the dynamics of
   science and help design indicators to evaluate the scientific impact of
   scholars, journals and academic institutions. Thus, scientometrics
   transformed fast into the exciting new discipline of Science of Science,
   which seeks to understand, quantify and predict research activities and
   the corresponding outcomes. In this article we provide a brief coverage
   of very recent work related to scientific ranking and impact prediction,
   aim at deepening our faith to Science of Science and stimulating further
   efforts in this transdisciplinary field.},

Title = {Practical operation and theoretical basis of difference-in-difference
   regression in science of science: The comparative trial on the
   scientific performance of Nobel laureates versus their coauthors},

Abstract = {Purpose: In recent decades, with the availability of large-scale
   scientific corpus datasets, difference-in-difference (DID) is
   increasingly used in the science of science and bibliometrics studies.
   DID method outputs the unbiased estimation on condition that several
   hypotheses hold, especially the common trend assumption. In this paper,
   we gave a systematic demonstration of DID in the science of science, and
   the potential ways to improve the accuracy of DID
   method.Design/methodology/approach: At first, we reviewed the
   statistical assumptions, the model specification, and the application
   procedures of DID method. Second, to improve the necessary assumptions
   before conducting DID regression and the accuracy of estimation, we
   introduced some matching techniques serving as the pre-selecting step
   for DID design by matching control individuals who are equivalent to
   those treated ones on observational variables before the intervention.
   Lastly, we performed a case study to estimate the effects of
   prizewinning on the scientific performance of Nobel laureates, by
   comparing the yearly citation impact after the prizewinning year between
   Nobel laureates and their prizewinning-work coauthors.Findings: We
   introduced the procedures to conduct a DID estimation and demonstrated
   the effectiveness to use matching method to improve the results. As a
   case study, we found that there are no significant increases in
   citations for Nobel laureates compared to their prizewinning
   coauthors.Research limitations: This study ignored the rigorous
   mathematical deduction parts of DID, while focused on the practical
   parts.Practical implications: This work gives experimental practice and
   potential guidelines to use DID method in science of science and
   bibliometrics studies.Originality/value: This study gains insights into
   the usage of econometric tools in science of science.},

Title = {An overview of the history of Science of Science in China based on the
   use of bibliographic and citation data: a new method of analysis based
   on clustering with feature maximization and contrast graphs},

Abstract = {In the first part of this paper, we shall discuss the historical context
   of Science of Science both in China and at world level. In the second
   part, we use the unsupervised combination of GNG clustering with feature
   maximization metrics and associated contrast graphs to present an
   analysis of the contents of selected academic journal papers in Science
   of Science in China and the construction of an overall map of the
   research topics' structure during the last 40 years. Furthermore, we
   highlight how the topics have evolved through analysis of publication
   dates and also use author information to clarify the topics' content.
   The results obtained have been reviewed and approved by 3 leading
   experts in this field and interestingly show that Chinese Science of
   Science has gradually become mature in the last 40 years, evolving from
   the general nature of the discipline itself to related disciplines and
   their potential interactions, from qualitative analysis to quantitative
   and visual analysis, and from general research on the social function of
   science to its more specific economic function and strategic function
   studies. Consequently, the proposed novel method can be used without

   very clear and precise insights about the development of a scientific
   domain. The output of the topic extraction part of the method
   (clustering + feature maximization) is finally compared with the output
   of the well-known LDA approach by experts in the domain which serves to
   highlight the very clear superiority of the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {From the standpoint of science of science and science-measuring, in
   general, the development of the modern theory of control of technical
   systems and, in particular, of self-organized adaptive systems, is
   analyzed. The undoubted priority of home science in this field,
   especially at the first stage of the fifty-year development of the
   modern theory, is stressed. Along with this, the lack of progress in
   solving, according to modern requirements, number of problems associated
   with the splitting of theoretical directions and the coordination,
   integration, and connection between theory and practice is stated. The
   possibility of solving problems of an adaptive controller on the basis
   of principles recently developed is stressed. An approximate theory and
   algorithmic facilities are presented. A revival of science of science in
   the field of automatic and automated systems of control by efforts of
   scientists-professionals in this area themselves is recommended.},

Abstract = {Identifying fundamental drivers of science and developing predictive
   models to capture its evolution are instrumental for the design of
   policies that can improve the scientific enterprise-for example, through
   enhanced career paths for scientists, better performance evaluation for
   organizations hosting research, discovery of novel effective funding
   vehicles, and even identification of promising regions along the
   scientific frontier. The science of science uses large-scale data on the

Abstract = {Liu and coauthors review the major data sources, measures and analysis
   methods in the science of science, discussing how recent developments in
   these fields can help researchers to better predict science-making
   outcomes and design better science policies.
   The advent of large-scale datasets that trace the workings of science
   has encouraged researchers from many different disciplinary backgrounds
   to turn scientific methods into science itself, cultivating a rapidly
   expanding `science of science'. This Review considers this growing,
   multidisciplinary literature through the lens of data, measurement and
   empirical methods. We discuss the purposes, strengths and limitations of
   major empirical approaches, seeking to increase understanding of the
   field's diverse methodologies and expand researchers' toolkits. Overall,
   new empirical developments provide enormous capacity to test traditional
   beliefs and conceptual frameworks about science, discover factors
   associated with scientific productivity, predict scientific outcomes and
   design policies that facilitate scientific progress.},

Abstract = {This is the Guest Editor's introduction to the Special Issue on
   ``Science of Science: Conceptualizations and Models of Science{''},
   Journal of Informetrics. The introduction discusses challenges towards a
   theoretically grounded and practically useful science of science. It
   provides a brief chronological review of relevant work and argues for
   (1) the development of common frameworks for the comparison and
   combination of existing approaches, theories, laws, and measurements,
   (2) the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies of science,
   and (3) the operationalization of theoretical concepts in terms of
   measurement and empirical evidence. Next, three visual
   conceptualizations of science are discussed and compared. Each of them
   provides a framework for the comparison and combination of existing
   works, means to combine quantitative and qualitative data, and helps to
   operationalize and communicate theoretical concepts using empirical
   data. Last but not least, the contributions of and interlinkages among
   the papers included in this issue are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Society is increasingly asking federally funded science to demonstrate
   its returns on investment. This has spawned an emerging science of
   science and innovation policy community that seeks predictive knowledge
   to allow policymakers to more effectively steer the course of science
   toward social goals. This is a laudable effort, but it is making a
   ``black box{''} out of the inevitable value judgments entailed in
   quantifying outcomes. A better approach would be to open the black box
   by engaging in fundamental inquiry about the good we hope science will
   deliver. But this may be a utopian project.},

   decades, but there remain difficult problems of finding proxies for
   subtle concepts, endogeneity, distinguishing private and social returns,
   untangling cumulative effects, measuring the impact of government

Title = {Examining Open Innovation in Science (OIS): what Open Innovation can and
   cannot offer the science of science},
Journal = {INNOVATION-ORGANIZATION \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 DEC 4},
Abstract = {Scholars across disciplines increasingly hear calls for more open and
   collaborative approaches to scientific research. The concept of Open
   Innovation in Science (OIS) provides a framework that integrates
   dispersed research efforts aiming to understand the antecedents,
   contingencies, and consequences of applying open and collaborative
   research practices. While the OIS framework has already been taken up by
   science of science scholars, its conceptual underpinnings require
   further specification. In this essay, we critically examine the OIS
   concept and bring to light two key aspects: 1) how OIS builds upon Open
   Innovation (OI) research by adopting its attention to boundary-crossing
   knowledge flows and by adapting other concepts developed and researched
   in OI to the science context, as exemplified by two OIS cases in the
   area of research funding; 2) how OIS conceptualises knowledge flows
   across boundaries. While OI typically focuses on well-defined
   organisational boundaries, we argue that blurry and even invisible
   boundaries between communities of practice may more strongly constrain
   flows of knowledge related to openness and collaboration in science.
   Given the uptake of this concept, this essay brings needed clarity to
   the meaning of OIS, which has no particular normative orientation
   towards a close coupling between science and industry. We end by
   outlining the essay's contributions to OI and the science of science, as
   well as to science practitioners.},

Abstract = {In this paper I examine Paul Thagard's computational approach to
   studying science, which is a contribution to the cognitive science of
   science. I present several criticisms of Thagard's approach and use them
   to motivate some suggestions for alternative approaches in cognitive
   science of science. I first argue that Thagard does not dearly establish
   the units of analysis of his study. Second, I argue that Thagard
   mistakenly applies the same model to both individual and group decision
   making. Finally, I argue that in attempting to account for psychological
   and social processes as well as providing a philosophical model of
   successful reasoning Thagard attempts to explain too much with one
   model, thus straining the plausibility of his model.},

Abstract = {The Science of Science \& Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program at the
   National Science Foundation (NSF) supports research designed to advance
   the scientific basis of science and innovation policy. The program was
   established at NSF in 2005 in response to a call from Dr. John Marburger
   III, then science advisor to the U. S. President, for a ``science{''} of
   science policy. It has co-funded 162 awards that aim to develop,
   improve, and expand data, analytical tools, and models that can be
   directly applied in the science policy decision making process. The
   long-term goals of the SciSIP program are to provide a scientifically
   rigorous and quantitative basis for science policy and to establish an
   international community of practice. The program has an active listserv
   that, as of January 2011, has almost 700 members from academia,
   government, and industry.
   This study analyzed all SciSIP awards (through January 2011) to identify
   existing collaboration networks and co-funding relations between SciSIP
   and other areas of science. In addition, listserv data was downloaded
   and analyzed to derive complementary discourse information. Key results
   include evidence of rich diversity in communication and funding networks
   and effective strategies for interlinking researcher and science policy
   makers, prompting discussion, and resource sharing.},

Abstract = {Scientific inquiry, like all other human activity, cannot be separated
   from the humans conducting the inquiry. While public discourse often
   treats science as sacrosanct and scientists as devoid of any but the
   purest motives, the science of science literature has long understood
   scientific inquiry as a fundamentally social activity undertaken by
   self-interested, partial, human choosers with limited information
   (Polanyi in Minerva 1(1):54-73, 1962; Kuhn in The structure of
   scientific revolutions. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL,
   1962; Leonard in J Econ Methodol 9(2):141-168, 2002). In this essay, we
   review the assumptions of two of the original contributions to the
   science of science literature regarding human agents and compare them to
   the assumptions underlying economic models. We assert that Michael
   Polanyi and Thomas Kuhn did for the science of science literature what
   Buchanan and Tullock (The calculus of consent: Logical foundations of
   constitutional democracy. Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1962) did for
   politics in the 1950s, which is to reassert behavioral symmetry. We then
   extend some of Buchanan's insights from his study of politics and
   constitutions, public choice and constitutional political economy, to
   the study of science and draw out implications for interest-group
   influence in the republic of science.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore if elite scientists play a key
   role in the genesis of transformative research. As there exist different
   types of transformative research, this paper focuses on one type of
   work, i.e. under-cited influential work,referred to as ``sparking{''}
   articles. A comparative study between the h-indices of authors citing
   Nobel Prize-winning papers of sparking type and those of authors citing
   ordinary ones is conducted, focusing on the first author and the
   corresponding author of each paper. The results show that the citers of
   the Top 1\% or Top 10\% Citations Sets in the sparking group have much
   higher h-indices than those in the ordinary group. These findings imply
   that elite scientists, operationalized as those with a high h-index in
   the corresponding fields, are more sensitive to sparking work and, as
   such play a pivotal role in the genesis of transformative research. This
   investigation provides new insight into the study of detecting
   transformative research, and hence, contributes to the science of
   science.},

Abstract = {The Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program at the
   National Science Foundation (NSF) supports research designed to advance
   the scientific basis of science and innovation policy. The program was
   established at NSF in 2005 in response to a call from Dr. John Marburger
   III, then science advisor to the U.S. President, for a ``science{''} of
   science policy. As of January 2011, it has co-funded 162 awards that aim
   to develop, improve, and expand data, analytical tools, and models that
   can be directly applied in the science policy decision making process.
   The long-term goals of the SciSIP program are to provide a
   scientifically rigorous and quantitative basis for science policy and to
   establish an international community of practice. The program has an
   active listserv that, as of January 2011, has almost 700 members from
   academia, government, and industry. This study analyzed all SciSIP
   awards (through January 2011) to identify existing collaboration
   networks and co-funding relations between SciSIP and other areas of
   science. In addition, listserv data was downloaded and analyzed to
   derive complementary discourse information. Key results include evidence
   of rich diversity in communication and funding networks and effective
   strategies for interlinking researcher and science policy makers,
   prompting discussion, and resource sharing.},

Abstract = {In this article, we try to find out what Vasiliy Nalimov and Zinaida
   Mul'chenko exactly wrote in their famous book Naukometriya, the Study of
   the Development of Science as an Information Process (1969). Afterward,
   the term Naukometriya became known in the West as Scientometrics.
   It is often mentioned that Nalimov invented the term scientometrics,
   usually with reference to his book published in 1969. Shouldn't
   Mul'chenko be mentioned as one of the inventors of this term? We show
   that referring to Naukometriya is a case of wrong reference, as Nalimov
   introduced the term already in 1966.
   We further place the term scientometrics in the context of the science
   of science and of Soviet science during that period.},

Abstract = {Understanding the structure of knowledge domains is one of the
   foundational challenges in the science of science. Here, we propose a
   neural embedding technique that leverages the information contained in
   the citation network to obtain continuous vector representations of
   scientific periodicals. We demonstrate that our periodical embeddings
   encode nuanced relationships between periodicals and the complex
   disciplinary and interdisciplinary structure of science, allowing us to
   make cross-disciplinary analogies between periodicals. Furthermore, we
   show that the embeddings capture meaningful ``axes{''} that encompass
   knowledge domains, such as an axis from ``soft{''} to ``hard{''}
   sciences or from ``social{''} to ``biological{''} sciences, which allow
   us to quantitatively ground periodicals on a given dimension. By
   offering novel quantification in the science of science, our framework
   may, in turn, facilitate the study of how knowledge is created and
   organized.},

Abstract = {While ISSI was founded in 1993, Scientometrics and Bibliometrics are now
   at least half a century old. Indeed, the field can be traced to early
   quantitative studies in the early 20th century. In the 1930s, it evolved
   to the ``science of science.{''} The publication of J.D. Bernal's Social
   Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay
   dormant until after World War II, when D.J.D. Price's books Science
   Since Babylon and Little Science, Big Science were published in 1961 and
   1963. His role as the ``Father of Scientometrics{''} is clearly evident
   by using the HistCite software to visualize his impact as well as the
   subsequent impact of the journal Scientometrics on the growth of the
   field. Scientometrics owes its name to V.V. Nalimov, the author of
   Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who adapted the neologism for the
   journal. The primordial paper on citation indexing by Garfield which
   appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge between Bernal and Price. The
   timeline for the evolution of Scientometrics is demonstrated by a
   HistCite tabulation of the ranked citation index of the 100,000
   references cited in the 3000 papers citing Price. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The science of science (SOS) is a rapidly developing field which aims to
   understand, quantify and predict scientific research and the resulting
   outcomes. The problem is essentially related to almost all scientific
   disciplines and thus has attracted attention of scholars from different
   backgrounds. Progress on SOS will lead to better solutions for many
   challenging issues, ranging from the selection of candidate faculty
   members by a university to the development of research fields to which a
   country should give priority. While different measurements have been
   designed to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars, journals and
   academic institutions, the multiplex structure, dynamics and evolution
   mechanisms of the whole system have been much less studied until
   recently. In this article, we review the recent advances in SOS, aiming
   to cover the topics from empirical study, network analysis, mechanistic
   models, ranking, prediction, and many important related issues. The
   results summarized in this review significantly deepen our understanding
   of the underlying mechanisms and statistical rules governing the science
   system. Finally, we review the forefront of SOS research and point out
   the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as
   to stimulate further efforts in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

Abstract = {While ISSI was founded in 1993, scientometrics and bibliometrics are now
   at least half a century old. Indeed, the field can be traced to early
   quantitative studies in the early 20(th) Century. In the thirties, it
   evolved to the ``science of science.{''} The publication of J. D.
   Bernal's Social Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point
   but the field lay dormant until after World War II, when DJD Price's
   books Science Since Babylon in and Little Science, Big Science in were
   published in1961 and 1963. His role as the ``father of
   scientometrics{''} is clearly evident by using the HislCite software to
   visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal
   Scientometrics on the growth of the field. Scientometrics owes its name
   to V. V. Nalimov, the author of Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who
   adapted the neologism for the journal. The primordial paper on citation
   indexing by Garfield which appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge
   between Bernal and Price. The timeline for the evolution of
   scientometrics is demonstrated by a HistCite tabulation of the ranked
   citation index of all the 100,000 references cited in the 3,000 papers
   citing Price.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the ``science of science{''} has combined computational
   methods with novel data sources to understand the dynamics of research
   communities. Many of the questions investigated by science of science
   are also relevant to academic philosophy. To what extent can the
   discipline be divided into subfields with different methods and topics?
   How are prestige and credit distributed across the discipline? And how
   do these factors interact with other factors, such as gender, to shape
   job market outcomes? Using job market data for anglophone academic
   philosophy, this paper finds, first, evidence that is consistent with
   the analytic-continental divide but is also consistent with other, more
   complex ways of organizing academic philosophy into distinct
   intellectual traditions; second, a clear prestige hierarchy, dividing
   Ph.D. programs into two distinct prestige categories; and, third,
   evidence that gender, prestige, and country have notable effects on
   academic job market outcomes for recent philosophy Ph.Ds.},

Abstract = {metaknowledge is a full-featured Python package for computational
   research in information science, network analysis, and science of
   science. It is optimized to scale efficiently for analyzing very large
   datasets, and is designed to integrate well with reproducible and open
   research workflows. It currently accepts raw data from the Web of
   Science, Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and select
   funding agencies. It processes these raw data inputs and outputs a
   variety of datasets for quantitative analysis, including time series
   methods, Standard and Multi Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy,
   computational text analysis (e.g. topic modeling, burst analysis), and
   network analysis (including multi-mode, multi-level, and longitudinal
   networks). This article motivates the use of metaknowledge and explains
   its design and core functionality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The article discusses the unprecedented opportunities of bringing big
   data for studies of science. Due to the dramatic change in how quickly
   and in what volumes data can be extracted from open sources, the science
   of science has been developed offering research of science based on
   large-scale metadata. The scale of the data is especially valuable for
   the study of science, which is characterized by a high level of
   stratification and segmentation. In turn, the techniques of network and
   computational text analysis have influenced how research questions were
   proposed. These new tools declare far-reaching implications for the
   science of science because researchers have the possibility to employ a
   flexible approach and refuse to rely on pre-define dcategories, as was
   common for previous studies in the sociology of science. New
   opportunities in data collection and analysis have attracted researchers
   from diverse scientific fields. The result is the application of new
   conceptual models that are no longer limited to sociological
   conceptualizations.},

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on the International Journal of Human-Computer
   Studies (IJHCS) as a domain of analysis, to gain insights about its
   evolution in the past 50 years and what this evolution tells us about
   the research landscape associated with the journal. To this purpose we
   use techniques from the field of Science of Science and analyse the
   relevant scholarly data to identify a variety of phenomena, including
   significant geopolitical patterns, the key trends that emerge from a
   topic-centric analysis, and the insights that can be drawn from an
   analysis of citation data. Because the area of Human-Computer
   Interaction (HCI) has always been a central focus for IJHCS, we also
   include in the analysis the CHI conference, which is the premiere
   scientific venue in HCI. Analysing both venues provides more data points
   to our study and allows us to consider two alternative viewpoints on the
   evolution of HCI research.},

Abstract = {The US National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Division of Policy Research
   and Analysis (PRA) supported academic research related to, among many
   other things, measurement of the returns to private and public R\&D,
   during the early 1980s. The findings from this body of research became a
   foundation for a number of technology and innovation policies
   promulgated in the aftermath of the US productivity slowdown in the
   1970s, and, as we suggest in this paper, a foundation for many
   contemporary technology and innovation policy initiatives. We argue that
   there are lessons to be learned from PRA's successes from its
   sponsorship of research in this area, and we suggest one possible area
   of future emphasis for NSF's ongoing Science of Science and Innovation
   Policy program.},

Abstract = {We discuss, at the macro-level of nations, the contribution of research
   funding and rate of international collaboration to research performance,
   with important implications for the ``science of science policy{''}. In
   particular, we cross-correlate suitable measures of these quantities
   with a scientometric-based assessment of scientific success, studying
   both the average performance of nations and their temporal dynamics in
   the space defined by these variables during the last decade. We find
   significant differences among nations in terms of efficiency in turning
   (financial) input into bibliometrically measurable output, and we
   confirm that growth of international collaboration positively correlate
   with scientific success with significant benefits brought by EU
   integration policies. Various geo-cultural clusters of nations naturally
   emerge from our analysis. We critically discuss the factors that
   potentially determine the observed patterns. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {An outstanding scientist and organizer of science, Corresponding Member
   of the USSR Academy of Sciences S.R. Mikulinskii (1919-1991), who in the
   1960-1980s determined the general line of development of the history of
   science and laid the foundations of the science of science, went through
   a life full of tragic events. His biography included years of study,
   participation in the Great Patriotic War, years of Nazi captivity in
   Germany followed by imprisonment in Soviet concentration camps, and a
   rapid scientific career unexpectedly interrupted by expulsion from the
   Institute of the Natural History and Technology (IIET) of the USSR
   Academy of Sciences, which he himself had fostered. Under his direction,
   the IIET of the USSR Academy of Sciences employed prominent scientists
   of the most diverse specialties, and the Institute reached the highest
   level of development, becoming the center of historical and scientific
   thought recognized in the world.},

Title = {Nature of Science (NOS) Being Acquainted with Science of Science (SoS):
   Providing a Panoramic Picture of Sciences to Embody NOS for Pre-Service
   Teachers},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding about nature of science is important topic in science
   education as well as in pre-service science teacher education. In
   science education, Nature of Science (NOS), in its different forms of
   educational scaffoldings, seeks to provide with students an
   understanding of features of scientific knowledge and science in
   general, how scientific knowledge changes and becomes accepted, and what
   factors guide scientific activities. For a science teacher, deep and
   broad enough picture of sciences is therefore of importance. This study
   attempts to show that the research field called Science of Science (SoS)
   can significantly support building such a panoramic picture of sciences,
   and through that, significantly support NOS. The SoS approaches the
   structure and dynamics of science quantitatively, using scientific
   documents (e.g., publications, reports, books and monographs and patent
   applications) as trails to map the landscape of sciences. It is argued
   here that SoS may provide material and interesting cases for NOS, and in
   so doing enrich NOS in a similarly significant way as history,
   philosophy and sociology of science (HPSS) scholarship has done thus
   far. This study introduces several themes based on SoS that are of
   relevance for NOS as they were introduced and discussed in a pre-service
   science teachers' course. The feedback from pre-service teachers shows
   that introducing SoS, with minimal additional philosophical
   interpretations and discussions, but simply as evidential facts and
   findings, sparks ideas and views that come very close to NOS themes and
   topics. Discussions related to nature of science, and specific
   educational NOS scaffoldings for it, can find a good companion in SoS;
   the latter providing facts and evidence of thee structure and dynamics
   of sciences, the former providing perspectives for interpretations.},

Abstract = {A meta-analysis is a Science of Science method widely used in the
   medical and social sciences to review, aggregate and quantitatively
   synthesise a body of studies that address the same research question.
   With the volume of research growing exponentially every year, conducting
   meta-analyses can be costly and inefficient, as a significant amount of
   time and human efforts needs to be spent in finding studies meeting
   research criteria, annotating them, and properly performing the
   statistical analyses to summarise the findings. In this work, we show
   these issues can be tackled with semantic representations and
   technologies, using a social science scenario as case-study. We show how
   the domain-specific content of research outputs can be represented and
   used to facilitate their search, analysis and synthesis. We present the
   very first representation of the domain of human cooperation, and the
   application we built on top of this to help experts in performing
   meta-analyses semi-automatically. Using few application scenarios, we
   show how our approach supports the various phases meta-analyses, and
   more in general contributes towards research replication and automated
   hypotheses generation.},

Abstract = {In this era of interdisciplinary science, many scientific achievements,
   such as artificial intelligence (AI), have brought dramatic revolutions
   to human society. The increasing availability of digital data on
   scholarly outputs offers unprecedented opportunities to explore science
   of science (SciSci). Despite many significant works have been done on
   SciSci, substantial disciplinary differences in different domains make
   some insights inadequate within particular fields. One thing standing
   out is that knowledge concerning the science behind AI is sorely
   lacking. In this work, we study the evolution of AI from three
   dimensions, including the evolution of trend, mobility, and
   collaboration. We find that the AI research hotspots have shifted from
   theory to application. The USA, which has the largest number of
   distinguished AI scientists, appeals most to the global AI talents. The
   brain drain problem of AI scientists is increasingly serious in
   developing countries. The ties among the AI elites are highly clustered
   in the collaboration network. Overall, our work aims to serve as a
   starter and support the development of AI exploring in a visionary way.

Abstract = {What science does, what science could do, and how to make science work?
   If we want to know the answers to these questions, we need to be able to
   uncover the mechanisms of science, going beyond metrics that are easily
   collectible and quantifiable. In this perspective piece, we link metrics
   to mechanisms by demonstrating how emerging metrics of science not only
   offer complementaries to existing ones, but also shed light on the
   hidden structure and mechanisms of science. Based on fundamental
   properties of science, we classify existing theories and findings into:
   hot and cold science referring to attention shift between scientific
   fields, fast and slow science reflecting productivity of scientists and
   teams, soft and hard science revealing reproducibility of scientific
   research. We suggest that interest about mechanisms of science since
   Derek J. de Solla Price, Robert K. Merton, Eugene Garfield, and many
   others complement the zeitgeist in pursuing new, complex metrics without

Abstract = {Cultural evolution research is the study of how cultural traits (e.g.,
   beliefs and behavioral patterns) stabilize, change and diffuse in
   populations, and why some cultural traits are more ``attractive{''}
   (i.e., more likely to spread) than others. As such, cultural evolution
   is highly relevant for the emerging ``science of science
   communication{''} (SSC) in that it can help organize and guide the study
   of science communication efforts aimed at spreading scientifically
   accurate information and inspiring behavioral change. Here, I synthesize
   insights and theory from cultural evolution with central findings and
   concepts within the SSC with the aim of highlighting the inherent, but
   underexplored, consilience between these two fields. I demonstrate how
   cultural evolution can serve as an unifying framework for the SSC and
   how, conversely, science communication can serve as a fertile testing
   ground for applying, exploring, and advancing cultural evolutionary
   theory in a real-world setting that matters. Lastly, I highlight merits
   and limitations of previous applications of cultural evolution to
   science communication and conclude with some particularly outstanding
   questions that emerge at the intersection between cultural evolution and
   science communication research.},

Abstract = {Meta-research, or the science of science, is a powerful technique that
   scientists can use to improve science, however most scientists are
   unaware that meta-research exists and courses are rare. This initiative
   demonstrates the feasibility of a participant-guided ``learn by
   doing{''} approach, in which a multidisciplinary, global team of early
   career researchers learned meta-research skills by working together to
   design, conduct and publish a meta-research study.},

Abstract = {This paper is an examination of the philosophical and political legacy
   of John Desmond Bernal. It addresses the evidence of an emerging
   consensus on Bernal based on the recent biography of Bernal by Andrew
   Brown and the reviews it has received. It takes issue with this view of
   Bernal, which tends to be admiring of his scientific contribution,
   bemused by his sexuality, condescending to his philosophy and hostile to
   his politics. This article is a critical defence of his philosophical
   and political position.},

Title = {Tracing the evolution of AI in the past decade and forecasting the
   emerging trends},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {209},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), especially the explosion of deep learning-related
   connectionist approaches. This study combines traditional literature
   review, bibliometric methods, and the Science of Science (SciSci) theory
   to scrutinize the development context of AI in the last decade on
   AMiner.(2) With the assistance of AMiner tools and datasets, this paper
   aims to describe a further explicit context and evolution of AI in the
   past decade from the development of connectionist approaches. Five
   aspects of the past decade are highlighted: self-learning and
   self-coding algorithms, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) algorithms,
   reinforcement learning, pre-trained models, and other typical deep
   learning algorithms, which represent the significant progress of this
   field. By combining these critical parts, we then summarize the current
   limitations and corresponding future of AI trends in the next decade and
   discuss some topics about the next generation of AI. Discoveries in this
   paper will benefit AI research in promoting understanding of the current
   critical stage and future trends of AI development and the AI industry
   in the dramatic ascendant for the academic research results
   transformation and its industrial layout.},

Journal = {VOPROSY FILOSOFII},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {104-114},
Abstract = {The widespread use of bibliometric indicators in science management,
   associated with the ideology of pseudo-economic positivism, is not only
   a specific tool for evaluating the work of scientists, but also a
   serious challenge to the self-consciousness of the scientific community.
   After a while this simplified language becomes the usual language of a
   scientist's ``self-observation{''}. At the same time, the expansion of
   this language meets with increasing resistance that is manifested not
   only in publications of individuals but also in declarations of
   authoritative organizations. Science should find a way to give
   appropriate response to the challenges of the ``audit society{''}.
   Philosophy of complexity considers the self-consciousness of science as
   a complex organism, as a system containing a lot of subsystems, that
   develops under influence of many internal and external factors, is
   necessary for this purpose. It implies the development of ``science of
   science{''} (SciSci) as a complex discipline within there would be a
   real interaction between the philosophy of science, history of science,
   sociology of science, scientometrics, psychology of scientific
   creativity, economy of science, studies in policy in science an legal
   regulation and legal aspects of scientific activity.},

Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of paper and author citations is of
   paramount importance for the design of research policies and evaluation
   criteria that can promote and accelerate scientific discoveries.
   Recently many studies on the evolution of science have been conducted in
   the context of the emergent Science of Science field. While many studies
   have probed the link problem in citation networks, only a few works have
   analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction in author citation
   networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10 well-known
   local network similarity measurements with four machine learning models
   to predict future links in author citations networks. Differently from
   traditional link prediction methods, the temporal nature of the predict
   links is relevant for our approach. Our analysis revealed that the
   Jaccard coefficient was found to be among the most relevant
   measurements. The preferential attachment measurement, conversely,
   displayed the worst performance. We also found that the extension of
   local measurements to their weighted version do not significantly
   improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we also found
   that a XGBoost and neural network approach summarizing the information
   from all 10 considered similarity measurements was able to provide the
   highest AUC performance and competitive precision values.},

Abstract = {The enormous increase in digital scholarly data and computing power
   combined with recent advances in text mining, linguistics, network
   science, and scientometrics make it possible to scientifically study the
   structure and evolution of science on a large scale. This paper
   discusses the challenges of this `BIG science of science'aEuro{''}also
   called `computational scientometrics' research-in terms of data access,
   algorithm scalability, repeatability, as well as result communication
   and interpretation. It then introduces two infrastructures: (1) the
   Scholarly Database (SDB) ( http://sdb.slis.indiana.edu ), which provides
   free online access to 22 million scholarly records-papers, patents, and
   funding awards which can be cross-searched and downloaded as dumps, and
   (2) Scientometrics-relevant plug-ins of the open-source Network
   Workbench (NWB) Tool ( http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu ). The utility of
   these infrastructures is then exemplarily demonstrated in three studies:
   a comparison of the funding portfolios and co-investigator networks of
   different universities, an examination of paper-citation and co-author
   networks of major network science researchers, and an analysis of topic
   bursts in streams of text. The article concludes with a discussion of
   related work that aims to provide practically useful and theoretically
   grounded cyberinfrastructure in support of computational scientometrics
   research, education and practice.},

Abstract = {How to achieve academic career success has been a long-standing research
   question in social science research. With the growing availability of
   large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories,
   scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has
   emerged to be an active research domain called the Science of Science
   (i.e., SciSci). In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic
   perspective to examine how individual and social factors will influence
   career success over time. We propose ACSeeker, an interactive visual
   analytics approach to explore the potential factors of success and how
   the influence of multiple factors changes at different stages of
   academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact Analysis
   framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic career
   success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to
   understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is
   designed to reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole
   population. A customized career line showing the individual career
   development is provided to allow a detailed inspection. To validate the
   effectiveness and usability of ACSeeker, we report two case studies and
   interviews with a social scientist and general researchers.},

Abstract = {Historically, science of science (Sci2) studies have been performed by
   single investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data
   sets and analyses scales up, a ``Big Science'' approach (Price, Little
   science, big science, 1963) is required that exploits the expertise and
   resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and
   industry boundaries. Big Sci2 studies utilize ``big data'', i.e., large,
   complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might
   be owned by different stake-holders. They apply a systems science
   approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations,
   and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of
   replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools,
   and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that
   was designed to support big Sci2 studies. The open access Scholarly
   Database (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26 million
   paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Sci2
   tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports temporal, geospatial, topical,
   and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined.
   Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of
   records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic
   growth. The number of edges rather than nodes determined performance for
   network based algorithms.},

Abstract = {We examine the evidence from large bibliometric databases to see if
   India is on the way to be able to `market its distinctive expertise in
   frugal innovation to the world' and to `establish a research programme
   on ``science of science and innovation policy{''} `; two of the
   recommendations that a recent celebrated report on India's potential for
   frugal innovation made. We find that there are countries which are more
   profligate than India in the scramble for leadership in innovation, and
   also that there are countries which are harnessing their resources more
   effectively toward the same goal.},

Title = {Climate-Science Communication and the Measurement Problem},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-43},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article examines the science-of-science-communication measurement
   problem. In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of
   externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural
   conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more
   fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement
   problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The beliefs
   individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of
   a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that
   individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to
   gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science and to
   enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined
   by particular cultural commitments. The article shows how appropriately
   designed science comprehension testsone general and one specific to
   climate changecan be used to measure individuals' reasoning proficiency
   as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning
   proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there
   is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what
   science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change
   controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination
   of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status
   competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express
   their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and
   cultural-identity protectors at the same time.},

Title = {Institutional Collaboration and Competition in Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The institutional collaboration and competition in academia have
   benefited the development of science, with inter-institutional
   scientific work promoting the exchange of ideas and competing fields
   developing rapidly. However, understanding of how the institutions
   collaborate and compete in science is sorely lacking, especially in
   emerging fields. Artificial intelligence is such a booming field
   currently, changing the way we live and work daily. To illustrate the
   problem, we try to reveal the evolution of institutional collaboration
   and competition in artificial intelligence by applying AI 2000 from the
   perspective of Science of Science. In this paper, we make multiple
   multidimensional statistical analyses by scrutinizing the collaboration
   network, research interests, talent flow, etc. We demonstrate the
   collaboration evolution in this field and find the advantage of
   inter-institutional collaboration is growing over time for papers that
   have been published more than 5 years. We discover the common
   cooperation modes of top institutions and visualize their closer
   cooperation. We highlight the critical resources competition among
   institutions in three dimensions and learn the recent trends in the
   field. In particular, we are concerned about the competition among
   institutions for cross-industry cooperation and notice the consistency
   of competitiveness and cross-industry collaboration. The research of
   this paper may support further research studies on institutional
   collaboration and competition as well as policy proposals for promoting
   scientific innovation, research management, and funding.},

Abstract = {Over the last century, we observe a steady and exponential growth of
   scientific publications globally. The overwhelming amount of available
   literature makes a holistic analysis of the research within a field and
   between fields based on manual inspection impossible. Automatic
   techniques to support the process of literature review are required to
   find the epistemic and social patterns that are embedded in scientific
   publications. In computer sciences, new tools have been developed to
   deal with large volumes of data. In particular, deep learning techniques
   open the possibility of automated end-to-end models to project
   observations to a new, low-dimensional space where the most relevant
   information of each observation is highlighted. Using deep learning to
   build new representations of scientific publications is a growing but
   still emerging field of research. The aim of this paper is to discuss
   the potential and limits of deep learning for gathering insights about
   scientific research articles. We focus on document-level embeddings
   based on the semantic and relational aspects of articles, using Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We explore
   the different outcomes generated by those techniques. Our results show
   that using NLP we can encode a semantic space of articles, while GNN we
   enable us to build a relational space where the social practices of a
   research community are also encoded.},

Abstract = {Citation graphs between scholarly papers can be used to learn about the
   structure and development of scholarship. We present a generalizable
   approach to visualizing scholarly influence over time, using a dynamic
   node-link diagram representing the citation patterns between groups of
   papers. We combine this approach with hierarchical clustering techniques
   that exploit the network structure to partition the graph into clusters
   representing fields and subfields. We use these methods to explore the
   influence that fields have had on other fields over time.},

   less well-known, but potentially most important, methodological
   undertakings: his work on metascience, or the science of science.
   Metascience could ultimately revolutionize our conceptualizations and
   understanding of science and provide considerable help to practicing
   scientists and scientific endeavors, including efforts to advance the
   development and appraisal of theories in psychology.},

Abstract = {Scholars present their new research at seminars and conferences and send
   drafts to peers in hopes of receiving comments and suggestions that will
   improve the quality of their work. Using a dataset of projects that were
   initiated when authors were doing their doctoral studies, this article
   measures how much peers' individual and collective comments improve the
   quality of research. Controlling for the quality of the research idea
   and author, I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the number
   of peers' individual and collective comments is associated with a 43\%
   increase in the quality of the journal in which the project is
   published.},

Abstract = {Establishing a strong scientific community is important as countries
   develop and requires both producing and retaining of important
   scientists. We show that developing countries produce a sizeable number
   of important scientists, but that they experience a tremendous brain
   drain. Education levels, population, and per capita GDP are positively
   related to the number of important scientists born in and staying in a
   country. Our analysis indicates that democracy and urbanization are
   associated with the production of more important scientists although
   democracy is associated with more out-migration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Finding leading scholars in a field effectively and efficiently is
   important and challenging in the science of science research. The
   present study focused on a specific field of mobile phone behavior as a
   prototypical case to demonstrate at a microscopic level the real-world
   complexity of how to find leading scholars in a newly emerging and
   highly interdisciplinary field of research scientifically. It used a
   novel mixed method combining content analysis and bibliometric analysis
   to identify and verify leading scholars in the field effectively and
   efficiently. The major findings of the study include that (1) a total of
   390 leading scholars in the field have been identified based on explicit
   recognition by 260 authors of 102 chapters of an encyclopedia of mobile
   phone behavior; (2) overall, peer recognition evidence of the identified
   390 leading scholars and bibliometric evidence of the three indicators
   for verifying leader scholars are relatively consistent; (3) among the
   four categories of the 390 leading scholars, the dominant one is the 273
   scholars who receive only one peer recognition but have strong
   bibliometric evidence, potentially due to the nature of either an
   emerging filed or an interdisciplinary field; and (4) the highest-cited
   citations could be considered the best bibliometric indicators for
   verifying leading scholars effectively and efficiently. Implications,
   future directions, and limitations are discussed.},

Abstract = {Vast numbers of scientific articles are published each year, some of
   which attract considerable attention, and some of which go almost
   unnoticed. Here, we investigate whether any of this variance can be
   explained by a simple metric of one aspect of the paper's presentation:
   the length of its title. Our analysis provides evidence that journals
   which publish papers with shorter titles receive more citations per
   paper. These results are consistent with the intriguing hypothesis that
   papers with shorter titles may be easier to understand, and hence
   attract more citations.},

Abstract = {Dominance hierarchies have been studied for almost 100 years. The
   science of science approach used here provides high-level insight into
   how the dynamics of dominance hierarchy research have shifted over this
   long timescale. To summarize these patterns, I extracted publication
   metadata using a Google Scholar search for the phrase `dominance
   hierarchy', resulting in over 26 000 publications. I used text mining
   approaches to assess patterns in three areas: (1) general patterns in
   publication frequency and rate, (2) dynamics of term usage and (3) term
   co-occurrence in publications across the history of the field. While the
   overall number of publications per decade continues to rise, the percent
   growth rate has fallen in recent years, demonstrating that although
   there is sustained interest in dominance hierarchies, the field is no
   longer experiencing the explosive growth it showed in earlier decades.
   Results from title term co-occurrence networks and community structure
   show that the different subfields of dominance hierarchy research were
   most strongly separated early in the field's history while modern
   research shows more evidence for cohesion and a lack of distinct term
   community boundaries. These methods provide a general view of the
   history of research on dominance hierarchies and can be applied to other
   fields or search terms to gain broad synthetic insight into patterns of
   interest, especially in fields with large bodies of literature. This
   article is part of the theme issue `The centennial of the pecking order:
   current state and future prospects for the study of dominance
   hierarchies'.},

   competition, organized by the Institute of Advanced Research in
   Artificial Intelligence, whose main goal was to predict the likelihood
   of future associations between machine learning concepts in a semantic
   network. The developed methodology corresponds to a solution for a
   scenario of availability of low computational power only, exploiting the
   extraction of low order topological features and its incorporation in an
   optimized classifier to estimate the degree of future connections
   between the nodes. The reasons that motivated the developed
   methodologies will be discussed, as well as some results, limitations
   and suggestions of improvements.},

Abstract = {The Turing Award is recognized as the most influential and prestigious
   award in the field of computer science (CS). With the rise of the
   science of science, a large amount of bibliographic data has been
   analyzed in an attempt to understand the hidden mechanism of scientific
   evolution. These include the analysis of the Nobel Prize, including
   physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. In this article, we extract and
   analyze the data of 72 Turing Award laureates from the complete
   bibliographic data, fill the gap in the lack of Turing Award analysis,
   and discover the development characteristics of CS as an independent
   discipline. First, we show most Turing Award laureates have long-term
   and high-quality educational backgrounds, and more than 61\% of them
   have a degree in mathematics, which indicates that mathematics has
   played a significant role in the development of CS. Secondly, the data
   shows that not all scholars have high productivity and high h-index;
   that is, the number of publications and h-index is not the leading
   indicator for evaluating the Turing Award. Third, the average age of
   awardees has increased from 40 to around 70 in recent years. This may be
   because new breakthroughs take longer, and some new technologies need
   time to prove their influence. Besides, we have also found that in the
   past 10 years, international collaboration has experienced explosive
   growth, showing a new paradigm in the form of collaboration. It is also
   worth noting that in recent years, the emergence of female winners has
   also been eye-catching. Finally, by analyzing the personal publication
   records, we find that many people are more likely to publish high-impact
   articles during their high-yield periods.},

Abstract = {We perform a statistical analysis of scientific-publication data with a
   goal to provide quantitative analysis of scientific process. Such an
   investigation belongs to the newly established field of scientometrics:
   a branch of the general science of science that covers all quantitative
   methods to analyze science and research process. As a case study we
   consider download and citation statistics of the journal ``Europhysics
   Letters{''} (EPL), as Europe's flagship letters journal of broad
   interest to the physics community. While citations are usually
   considered as an indicator of academic impact, downloads reflect rather
   the level of attractiveness or popularity of a publication. We discuss
   peculiarities of both processes and correlations between them.},

Abstract = {In Scientific Knowledge, Barry Barnes, David Bloor and John Henry (BBH)
   explicitly repudiate the notion that the physical environment prays no
   role in the creation of scientific knowledge, thereby removing a major
   bone of fruitless and heated contention between scientists and
   practitioners of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK). There
   remain, however, many aspects of BBH's view of scientific knowledge that
   clash with my own experience as a practitioner of (theoretical) physics.
   I offer some examples of ways in which BBH seem to get things wrong, in
   the hope of starting a more constructive dialogue, leading to a better
   understanding of sociology by scientists, and perhaps even vice-versa.},

Abstract = {Scientists must share their work with the public in order to promote
   science-based public discourse and policies. These acts of science
   communication are often evaluated in terms of their ability to inform
   (i.e., introduce accurate and accessible information) and engage (i.e.,
   capture interest and maintain attention). We focus on a third basis by
   which science communication might be judged, influence. Science
   communicators exert influence when they shape public opinions in ways
   that affect their judgments and decisions, alter social and political
   discourse and debate, and guide social policy. We describe how the
   influence of any given science communication should be evaluated
   independent of its ability to inform or engage. We give particular
   attention in our analysis to the often unintended influences that
   well-meaning science communicators can have. We begin by considering
   ways that communications from climate scientists might reduce support
   for climate regulation and communications from health scientists might
   undermine public health. We then develop two ``case studies,{''} drawn
   from social psychology. These show how popular media descriptions of the
   science of racial bias and disadvantage might in some cases exacerbate
   racial discrimination and reduce concern for the disadvantaged. We close
   with an agenda for a more vigorous science of science communication; one
   that engages in two complementary pursuits. Critical studies identify
   the dominant and consequential effects that popular science
   communicators are having on public perceptions. Strategic studies
   advance and empirically test communication strategies that scientists
   can pursue to reduce-rather than exacerbate-social problems.},

Abstract = {The goal of science education interventions is to nurture, enrich, and
   sustain children's natural and spontaneous interest in scientific
   knowledge and procedures. We present taxonomy for classifying different
   types of research on scientific thinking from the perspective of
   cognitive development and associated attempts to teach science. We
   summarize the literature on the early-unschooled-development of
   scientific thinking, and then focus on recent research on how best to
   teach science to children from preschool to middle school. We summarize
   some of the current disagreements in the field of science education and
   offer some suggestions on ways to continue to advance the science of
   science instruction.},

Abstract = {We propose using community-centered analyses and agent-based models of
   scientific gatherings such as conferences, symposia and workshops as a
   way to understand how scientific practices evolve and transition between
   local, community, and systems levels in science. We suggest using
   robotics as a case study of global, cross-cultural, interdisciplinary
   scientific practice. What is needed is a set of modeling frameworks for
   simulating both the internal and population dynamics of scientific
   gatherings. In this paper we make the case for conference models as a
   mid-level unit of analysis that can advance the ways scientists and
   citizens design systems for transferring and producing knowledge.},

Abstract = {Since the relaunch of Microsoft Academic Services (MAS) 4 years ago,
   scholarly communications have undergone dramatic changes: more ideas are
   being exchanged online, more authors are sharing their data, and more
   software tools used to make discoveries and reproduce the results are
   being distributed openly. The sheer amount of information available is
   overwhelming for individual humans to keep up and digest. In the
   meantime, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made great
   strides and the cost of computing has plummeted to the extent that it
   has become practical to employ intelligent agents to comprehensively
   collect and analyze scholarly communications. MAS is one such effort and
   this paper describes its recent progresses since the last disclosure. As
   there are plenty of independent studies affirming the effectiveness of
   MAS, this paper focuses on the use of three key AI technologies that
   underlies its prowess in capturing scholarly communications with
   adequate quality and broad coverage: (1) natural language understanding
   in extracting factoids from individual articles at the web scale, (2)
   knowledge assisted inference and reasoning in assembling the factoids
   into a knowledge graph, and (3) a reinforcement learning approach to
   assessing scholarly importance for entities participating in scholarly
   communications, called the saliency, that serves both as an analytic and
   a predictive metric in MAS. These elements enhance the capabilities of
   MAS in supporting the studies of science of science based on the GOTO
   principle, i.e., good and open data with transparent and objective
   methodologies. The current direction of development and how to access
   the regularly updated data and tools from MAS, including the knowledge
   graph, a REST API and a website, are also described.},

Abstract = {When the journal Minerva was founded in 1962, science and higher
   educational issues were high on the agenda, lending impetus to the
   interdisciplinary field of ``Science Studies{''} qua ``Science Policy
   Studies.{''} As government expenditures for promoting various branches
   of science increased dramatically on both sides of the East-West Cold
   War divide, some common issues regarding research management also
   emerged and with it an interest in closer academic interaction in the
   areas of history and policy of science. Through a close reading of many
   early issues of Minerva but also of its later competitor journal Science
   Studies (now called Social Studies of Science) the paper traces the
   initial optimism of an academically based Science Studies dialogue
   across the Cold War divide and the creation in 1971 of the International
   Commission for Science Policy Studies as a bridging forum, one that
   Minerva strangely chose to ignore. In this light, attention is drawn to
   aspects of the often forgotten history of Science Studies in the former
   Soviet Union and the Eastern European block. Reviewed also are several
   early discussions that are still relevant today: e.g., regarding
   differing concepts of Big Science, science and democracy, autonomy in
   higher education and what conditions are necessary to sustain academic
   freedom and scientific integrity (some of Edward Shils' primary
   concerns). Finally, it is noted how the question of quantitative methods
   to measure scientific productivity lay at the heart of a ``Science of
   Science{''} movement of the 1960s has re-emerged in a new form integral
   to the notion of a ``Science of Science Policy.{''}.},

Abstract = {In ISKO's name, the term ``Knowledge Organization{''} (KO) denotes
   already the object and the activity area significant for the existence
   of any science. Both areas are outlined and their specific contents
   shown. Also a survey of its special subfields is given. The
   science-theoretical foundation of Knowledge Organization as a new
   scientific discipline is based on the propositional concept of science.
   Within a universal system of the sciences, KO has been regarded as a
   subfield of Science of Science. Concludingly it is proposed to find the
   necessary institution for work in concerted effort of scientists,
   knowledge organizers and terminologists on the collection, definition,
   and systematization of concepts of all subject fields, utilizing the
   Information Coding Classification (ICC) as the necessary categorizing
   structure.},

Title = {Using text analysis to quantify the similarity and evolution of
   scientific disciplines},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We use an information-theoretic measure of linguistic similarity to
   investigate the organization and evolution of scientific fields. An
   analysis of almost 20M papers from the past three decades reveals that
   the linguistic similarity is related but different from experts and
   citation-based classifications, leading to an improved view on the
   organization of science. A temporal analysis of the similarity of fields
   shows that some fields (e.g. computer science) are becoming increasingly
   central, but that on average the similarity between pairs of disciplines
   has not changed in the last decades. This suggests that tendencies of
   convergence (e.g. multi-disciplinarity) and divergence (e.g.
   specialization) of disciplines are in balance.},

Abstract = {The implementation of policies promoting the adoption of an open science
   (OS) culture must be accompanied by indicators that allow monitoring the
   uptake of such policies and their potential effects on research
   publishing and sharing practices. This study presents indicators of open
   access (OA) at the institutional level for universities worldwide. By
   combining data from Web of Science, Unpaywall and the Leiden Ranking
   disambiguation of institutions, we track OA coverage of universities'
   output for 963 institutions. This paper presents the methodological
   challenges, conceptual discrepancies and limitations and discusses
   further steps needed to move forward the discussion on fostering OA and

Abstract = {All branches of science are expanding, and these changes tend to follow
   some predictable patterns. A majority of new sciences are the result of
   integrating other disciplines. Using a graph-based semantic network
   model, the paper demonstrates a method to predict the merging branches
   framed in a link prediction problem. The task of analyzing a graph with
   more than 65000 nodes and millions of edges is challenging. To overcome
   this challenge, we identify the most important graph features for this
   problem and show how to compute them efficiently. We train an LSTM on
   the data, optimize the data features and model hyperparameters and
   compare the results against a baseline model.},

   medium-scale structures in directed networks. We present a method using
   the composition of coloured graphlets in ego-networks to characterise
   nodes. We give an example application using our technique to predict the
   numbers of years researchers are active from their collaboration
   networks, and compare our success with simpler metrics; particularly, we
   find that the use of coloured graphlets improves predictive performance
   compared to colour-blind graphlets; that 4-star graphlets centred on an
   author are predictors of a long career, and that this effect is not
   degenerate to centralities.},

   accurate, and intelligent semantic querying as well as powerful
   recommendations. In addition, in order to realize information sharing,
   it provides open API to be served as the underlying architecture for
   advanced functions. Web of Scholars takes advantage of knowledge graph,
   which means that it will be able to access more knowledge if more search
   exist. It can be served as a useful and interoperable tool for scholars
   to conduct in-depth analysis within Science of Science.},

Abstract = {Why do irrational beliefs adopt the trappings of science, to become what
   is known as ``pseudoscience{''}? Here, we develop and extend an
   epidemiological framework to map the factors that explain the form and
   the popularity of irrational beliefs in scientific garb. These factors
   include the exploitation of epistemic vigilance, the misunderstanding of
   the authority of science, the use of the honorific title of
   ``science{''} as an explicit argument for belief, and the phenomenon of
   epistemic negligence. We conclude by integrating the various factors in
   an epidemiological framework and thus provide a comprehensive cultural
   evolutionary account of science mimicry.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Contemporary empiricism has attempted to ground its analysis of science
   in a falsificationism based in selection theory. This paper links these
   evolutionary epistemologies with commitments to certain epistemological
   and ontological assumptions found in the later work of K. Popper, D.
   Campbell, and D. Hull. I argue that their assumptions about the
   character of contemporary empiricism are part of a shared paradigm of
   epistemological explanation which results in unresolved tensions within
   their own projects.  I argue further that their claim to be doing a
   science of science is not defensible. Hull's selectionism is analyzed to
   show how this epistemological agenda has played itself out in late
   empiricism. I suggest some directions that Hull might take toward an
   historical epistemology.},

Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There are many approaches to the modelling of citation vectors of
   individual authors. Models may serve different purposes, but usually
   they are evaluated with regards to how well they align to citation
   distributions in large networks of papers. Here we compare a few leading
   models in terms of their ability to correctly reproduce the values of
   selected bibliometric indices of individual authors. Our
   recently-proposed three-dimensional model of scientific impact serves
   this purpose equally well as the discrete generalised beta distribution
   and the log-normal models, but has fewer parameters which additionally
   are all easy to interpret. We also indicate which indices can be
   predicted with high accuracy and which are more difficult to model.},

Abstract = {Every researcher alive today had their mentors, those who helped
   assimilate them into a life of scholarly work. And in turn they each had
   their mentors, and so on to the dawn of knowledge. In the same way, each
   researchers mentees take their perspectives and methods to future
   mentees, and to their mentees, etc. These comprise the roots and
   branches, respectively, of the academic tree of a single researcher. If
   we let these ancestors and descendants genders affect these trees like a
   ``wind,{''} most curl nearly to the earth. We depict and describe the
   structure of these trees, and how this wind has changed over the
   decades. To set these trees growing upright again we visualize giving
   differential weight to male and female researchers.},

Abstract = {STAR METRICS is a data platform that is being voluntarily and
   collaboratively developed by U.S. federal science agencies and research
   institutions to describe investments in science and their results. It
   initially emerged as a result of reporting requirements associated with
   the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; it has developed in
   response to a recognized need to begin to systematically document
   federal investments in science and their immediate and long-term
   results. The eventual goal is to draw information from existing data on
   scientific and economic activities as well as from research
   institutions' and federal science agencies' systems to provide data that
   can be used for a more scientific analysis of science investments and
   their outcomes.},

Abstract = {Knowledge communication plays a fundamental role in studies of science
   of science. This paper aims to examine inter-specialty communication
   patterns within a discipline using author citation networks. Two metrics
   are designed, including average knowledge flow and average shortest
   distance. They are used to identify the impact and diffusion
   characteristics of inter-specialty knowledge communication. We apply
   these metrics to an empirical data set of Chinese library and
   information science (CLIS) publications. We find that the two metrics
   portray different aspects of knowledge communication in CLIS and
   conclude that indirect paths, the size of specialties, and the
   communication structure among specialties may lead to the differences.},

Abstract = {Largely overlooked by researchers studying the science of science
   communication are the specific journalistic practices and media
   structures that might enable more constructive public debate in
   politicized science controversies. In this commentary, we discuss the
   role that journalists can play as influential knowledge professionals,
   drawing on insights from the studies in this section of the special
   issue. In doing so, we outline three complementary approaches to what
   Thomas Patterson calls knowledge-based journalism. By way of these
   approaches, journalists and their news organizations can contextualize
   and critically evaluate expert knowledge; facilitate discussion that
   bridges entrenched ideological divisions; and promote consideration of a
   broader menu of policy options and technologies. We conclude by
   discussing the implications for journalism education.},

   indexes by which it is possible to measure the validity of scientific
   research: number of articles, impact factor of the journal, the number
   and order of authors and citations number. Every scientific article is a
   record of the data written by the rules recommended by several
   scientific associations and committees. Growing number of authors and
   lot of authors with same name and surname led to the introduction of the
   necessary identification agent - ORCID number.},

Abstract = {Motivation and problem-domain preferences of scientists can affect
   aggregate level emergence and growth of problem domains in science. In
   this study, we introduce an agent-based model that is based on
   information foraging and expectancy theory to examine the impact of
   rationality and openness on the growth and evolution of scientific
   domains. We simulate a virtual socio-technical system, in which
   scientists with different preferences search for problem domains to
   contribute knowledge, while considering their motivational gains.
   Problem domains become mature and knowledge spills occur over time to
   facilitate creation of new problem domains. We conduct experiments to
   examine emergence and growth of clusters of domains based on local
   interactions and preferences of scientists and present preliminary
   qualitative observations.},

Title = {A SIR epidemic model for citation dynamics},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {136},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {The study of citations in the scientific literature crosses the
   boundaries between the traditional branches of science and stands on its
   own as a most profitable research field dubbed the `science of science.'
   Although the understanding of the citation histories of individual
   papers involves many intangible factors, the basic assumption that
   citations beget citations can explain most features of the empirical
   citation patterns. Here, we use the SIR epidemic model as a mechanistic
   model for the citation dynamics of well-cited papers published in
   selected journals of the American Physical Society. The estimated
   epidemiological parameters offer insight into unknown quantities as the
   size of the community that could cite a paper and its ultimate impact on
   that community. We find a good, though imperfect, agreement between the
   rank of the journals obtained using the epidemiological parameters and
   the impact factor rank.Graphic abstract},

Abstract = {Each year, researchers publish an immense number of scientific papers.
   While some receive many citations, others receive none. Here we
   investigate whether any of this variance can be explained by the choice
   of words in a paper's abstract. We find that doubling the word frequency
   of an average abstract increases citations by 0.70\%. We also find that
   journals which publish papers whose abstracts are shorter and contain
   more frequently used words receive slightly more citations per paper.
   Specifically, adding a 5 letter word to an abstract decreases the number
   of citations by 0.02\%. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that the style in which a paper's abstract is written bears some
   relation to its scientific impact. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Motivation and problem-domain preferences of scientists can affect
   aggregate level emergence and growth of problem domains in science. In
   this study, we introduce an agent-based model that is based on
   information foraging and expectancy theory to examine the impact of
   rationality and openness on the growth and evolution of scientific
   domains. We simulate a virtual socio-technical system, in which
   scientists with different preferences search for problem domains to
   contribute knowledge, while considering their motivational gains.
   Problem domains become mature and knowledge spills occur over time to
   facilitate creation of new problem domains. We conduct experiments to
   examine emergence and growth of clusters of domains based on local
   interactions and preferences of scientists and present preliminary
   qualitative observations.},

Abstract = {Classifying research papers according to their research topics is an
   important task to improve their retrievability, assist the creation of
   smart analytics, and support a variety of approaches for analysing and
   making sense of the research environment. In this paper, we present the
   CSO Classifier, a new unsupervised approach for automatically
   classifying research papers according to the Computer Science Ontology
   (CSO), a comprehensive ontology of research areas in the field of
   Computer Science. The CSO Classifier takes as input the metadata
   associated with a research paper (title, abstract, keywords) and returns
   a selection of research concepts drawn from the ontology. The approach
   was evaluated on a gold standard of manually annotated articles yielding
   a significant improvement over alternative methods.},

Abstract = {Usually the movement of Historical Epistemology has been characterized,
   in reference to its French academic root, for the immanent criticism of
   the concept of epistemology or theory of knowledge that it presupposes;
   the denunciation of the insufficiency of this concept is, as it is
   argued, a condition of possibility of the perspective of an
   epistemologically oriented history of science. This paper of exploratory
   character examines this criticism and reconstructs its arguments, while
   analyzes the relationship between history and epistemology and the
   problems that naturally arise according to the point of view adopted, as
   well as revising the genealogy of Historical Epistemology and its
   rejection, almost from its beginnings, to the positivist claim; the
   latter usually identified with the purpose of funding a ``science of
   science{''}.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth in the number of academics
   and practitioners who are interested in big scholarly data as well as
   closely-related areas. Quite a lot of papers reporting recent
   advancements in this area have been published in leading conferences and
   journals. Both non-commercial and commercial platforms and systems have
   been released in recent years, which provide innovative services built
   upon big scholarly data to the academic community. Examples include
   Microsoft Academic Graph, Google Scholar, DBLP, arXiv, CiteSeerX, Web of
   Knowledge, Udacity, Coursera, and edX. The workshop will contribute to
   the birth of a community having a shared interest around big scholarly
   data and exploring it using knowledge discovery, data science and
   analytics, network science, and other appropriate technologies.},

Abstract = {Education is not only a guarantee of personal knowledge, but also a
   topic of national importance. In this paper, we analyzed the scientific
   papers published by authors from China and the United States in 239
   educational journals over a period of 20 years (2000-2019). We first
   extracted the topic of each paper via the Latent Dirichlet allocation
   model, which demonstrated significant differences in specific sub-fields
   between both countries. Next, we constructed two networks of scientific
   collaboration among the educators of each country. By analyzing these
   networks' topological properties, we show both countries' differences
   and common features. Regarding individuals, Chinese educators
   collaborate widely, whereas American educators are more likely to
   collaborate in certain groups. Regarding groups, there exists an optimal
   team size for producing highly popular papers in both countries. (C)

Abstract = {Promoting public knowledge about climate is important for garnering
   support for climate-change policy, and researchers have begun to study
   the effectiveness of new technologies as learning tools. News
   organizations are increasingly producing immersive journalism, including
   virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and this study tests
   whether VR news can be an effective tool for learning about climate
   change. Based on results from a controlled, in-person laboratory
   experiment comparing an immersive VR news story to 360 degrees-video and
   text-with-images versions, we find no main effects on the learning
   outcomes. However, we do find indirect effects on cognitive elaboration,
   which are conditional on preexisting knowledge about climate change.
   Results are discussed in light of their implications for theory about
   learning in multimedia environments, as well as their implications for
   the science of science communication.},

Abstract = {In some fields, research findings are rigorously curated in a common
   language and made available to enable future use and large-scale, robust
   insights. Organizational researchers have begun such efforts {[}e.g.,
   metaBUS (http://metabus.org/)] but are far from the efficient,
   comprehensive curation seen in areas such as cognitive neuroscience or
   genetics. This review provides a sample of insights from research
   curation efforts in organizational research, psychology, and
   beyond-insights not possible by even large-scale, substantive
   meta-analyses. Efforts are classified as either science-of-science
   research or large-scale, substantive research. The various methods used
   for information extraction (e.g., from PDF files) and classification
   (e.g., using consensus ontologies) is reviewed. The review concludes
   with a series of recommendations for developing and leveraging the
   available corpus of organizational research to speed scientific
   progress.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to accelerate scientific discovery by studying link
   prediction in a semantic network. The nodes are unidentified concepts in
   machine learning, and the time-stamped edges indicate co-occurrence in
   scientific papers. Taking advantage of this temporal information, we
   perform node embedding on the graph at every year from 1994 to 2017, and
   apply two methods to find features for node pairs: the first method uses
   a transformer, while the other uses distance metrics combined with known
   link prediction features. The latter feature extraction technique with a
   3-layer multi-layer perceptron achieved an AUC of 0.902 on predicting
   edges in the 2020 graph. Inspection of the resulting features suggests
   that the model does indeed pay attention to the dynamic nature of the
   features, e.g., how node-pair distance in embedding space changes over
   the years.},

Abstract = {At several points over his career, Pierre Bourdieu articulated a
   framework for a sociology of science, derived mostly from a priori
   reasoning about scientific actors in competition for capital. This
   article offers a brief overview of Bourdieu's framework, placing it in
   the context of dominant trends in Science and Technology Studies.
   Bourdieu provides an excellent justification for the project of the
   sociology of science, and some starting points for analysis. However,
   his framework suffers from his commitment to a vague evolutionary
   epistemology, and from his correlative and surprising neglect of
   science's habituses, with their particular practices, boundaries, and
   political economies. To be productive, Bourdieu's sociology of science
   would have to abandon its narrow rationalism and embrace the material
   complexity of the sciences.},

Abstract = {Paul Meehl was a person of remarkable genius who made many seminal
   contributions to psychology and other fields. One of his most important,
   but less widely known potential contributions is the codevelopment, and
   the extension and elaboration of meta-science, or the science of
   science. Meta-science involves applying more rigorous methods (than are
   usually used) to the study of episodes in the history of science, or the
   historical track record, in order to address long-standing questions in
   the philosophy and history of science, aid in the selection of optimally
   effective methodology, and assist the scientist in higher level and
   complex integrative judgments (e.g., theory evaluation). Psychologists,
   given their methodological sophistication, can be major contributors to
   meta-scientific efforts and to the development of this field. (c) 2005

Abstract = {In the following interviews, literary critics Wolfgang Iser, Walter
   Muller-Seidel, and Eberhard Lammert report the cognitive and structural
   changes which occurred during the West German ``Hochschulreform{''} at
   the end of the 1960s. They situate these changes both within the history
   of literary criticism and within the context of the student revolts,
   which escalated after 1956 and increased pressure for reform,
   particularly in the field of teacher training. The introduction compares
   this period of initiatives, which was significantly influenced by the
   above-mentioned critics, to the 1920s and 1990s when literary criticism
   was exposed to a similar pressure for change. This shows that the
   history of science ({''}Wissenschaftsgeschichte{''}) and the science of
   science ({''}Wissenschaftsforschung{''}) are indispensable instruments
   of self-regulation within the discipline.},

Abstract = {Using latent semantic analysis on the full text of scientific articles,
   we measure the distance between 36 million citing/cited article pairs
   and chart changes in citation proximity over time. The analysis shows
   that the mean distance between citing and cited articles has steadily
   increased since 1990. This demonstrates that current scholars are more
   likely to cite distantly related research than their peers of 20 years
   ago who tended to cite more proximate work. These changes coincide with
   the introduction of new information technologies like the Internet, and
   the increasing popularity of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
   research. The ``citation distance{''} measure shows promise in improving
   our understanding of the evolution of knowledge. It also offers a method
   to add nuance to scholarly impact measures by assessing the extent to
   which an article influences proximate or distant future work.},

   Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 16569-16572 (2005)]) is opposed by those claiming
   that one?s scientific impact cannot be reduced to a single number. Some
   even believe that our complex reality fails to submit to any
   quantitative description. We argue that neither of the two controversial
   extremes is true. By assuming that some citations are distributed
   according to the rich get richer rule (suc- cess breeds success,
   preferential attachment) while some others are assigned totally at
   random (all in all, a paper needs a bibli- ography), we have crafted a
   model that accurately summarizes citation records with merely three
   easily interpretable parame- ters: productivity, total impact, and how
   lucky an author has been so far.},

Abstract = {Purpose: We aim to extend our investigations related to the Relative
   Intensity of Collaboration (RIC) indicator, by constructing a confidence
   interval for the obtained values.
   Design/methodology/approach: We use Mantel-Haenszel statistics as
   applied recently by Smolinsky, Klingenberg, and Marx.
   Findings: We obtain confidence intervals for the RIC indicator
   Research limitations: It is not obvious that data obtained from the Web
   of Science (or any other database) can be considered a random sample.
   Practical implications: We explain how to calculate confidence
   intervals. Bibliometric indicators are more often than not presented as
   precise values instead of an approximation depending on the database and
   the time of measurement. Our approach presents a suggestion to solve
   this problem.
   Originality/value: Our approach combines the statistics of binary
   categorical data and bibliometric studies of collaboration.},

Abstract = {A rising issue in the scientific community entails the identification of
   temporal patterns in the evolution of the scientific enterprise and the
   emergence of trends that influence scholarly impact. In this direction,
   this paper investigates the mechanism with which citation accumulation
   occurs over time and how this affects the overall impact of scientific
   output. Utilizing data regarding the SOFSEM Conference (International
   Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer
   Science), we study a corpus of 1006 publications with their associated
   authors and affiliations to uncover the effects of collaboration network
   on the conference output. We proceed to group publications into clusters
   based on the trajectories they follow in their citation acquisition.
   Representative patterns are identified to characterize dominant trends
   of the conference, while exploring phenomena of early and late
   recognition by the scientific community and their correlation with
   impact.},

Abstract = {Cognitive science is beginning to make a contribution to the
   science-and-religion dialogue by its claims about the nature of both
   scientific and religious knowledge and the practices such knowledge
   informs. Of particular importance is the distinction between folk
   knowledge and abstract theoretical knowledge leading to a distinction
   between folk science and folk religion on the one hand and the
   reflective, theoretical, abstract form of thought that characterizes
   both advanced scientific thought and sophisticated theological reasoning
   on the other. Both folk science and folk religion emerge from
   commonsense reasoning about the world, a form of reasoning bequeathed to
   us by the processes of natural selection. Suggestions are made about
   what scientists and theologians can do if they accept these claims.},

Abstract = {The US scientific workforce is primarily composed of White men. Studies
   have demonstrated the systemic barriers preventing women and other
   minoritized populations from gaining entry to science; few, however,
   have taken an intersectional perspective and examined the consequences
   of these inequalities on scientific knowledge. We provide a large-scale
   bibliometric analysis of the relationship between intersectional
   identities, topics, and scientific impact. We find homophily between
   identities and topic, suggesting a relationship between diversity in the
   scientific workforce and expansion of the knowledge base. However, topic
   selection comes at a cost to minoritized individuals for whom we observe
   both between- and within-topic citation disadvantages. To enhance the
   robustness of science, research organizations should provide adequate
   resources to historically underfunded research areas while
   simultaneously providing access for minoritized individuals into
   high-prestige networks and topics.},

Abstract = {Scientific collaboration is of significant importance in tackling grand
   challenges and breeding innovations. Despite the increasing interest in
   investigating and promoting scientific collaborations, we know little
   about the collaboration sustainability as well as mechanisms behind it.
   In this paper, we set out to study the relationships between early-stage
   reciprocity and collaboration sustainability. By proposing and defining
   h-index reciprocity, we give a comprehensive statistical analysis on how
   reciprocity influences scientific collaboration sustainability, and find
   that scholars are not altruism and the key to sustainable collaboration
   is fairness. The unfair h-index reciprocity has an obvious negative
   impact on collaboration sustainability. The bigger the reciprocity
   difference, the less sustainable in collaboration. This work facilitates
   understanding sustainable collaborations and thus will benefit both
   individual scholar in optimizing collaboration strategies and the whole
   academic society in improving teamwork efficiency. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper considers the adoption of computational techniques within
   research designs modeled after the extended case method. Echoing calls
   to augment the power of contemporary researchers through the adoption of
   computational text analysis methods, we offer a framework for thinking
   about how such techniques can be integrated into quasi-ethnographic
   workflows to address broad, structural sociological claims. We focus, in
   particular, on how this adoption of novel forms of evidence impacts
   corpus design and interpretation (which we tie to matters of casing),
   theoretical elaboration (which we associate to moving empirical claims
   across scales and empirical domains), and verification (which we see as
   a process of reflexive scaffolding of theoretical claims). We provide an
   example of the use of this framework through a study of the
   marketization of social scientific knowledge in the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Citation networks can reveal important information regarding the
   development of science and the relationship between different areas of
   knowledge. Frequently, citation networks are created using articles
   acquired from a set of relevant keywords or queries. Here, we study the
   robustness of citation networks communities with regards to the keywords
   that were used for collecting the respective articles. A perturbation
   approach is proposed, in which the influence of missing keywords on the
   community structure of citation networks is quantified. In addition, the
   relationship between keywords and the community structure of citation
   networks is studied using networks generated from a simple model. We
   find that, owing to its highly modular structure, the community
   structure of citation networks tends to be preserved even when many
   relevant keywords are left out. Furthermore, the proposed model can
   reflect the impact of missing keywords on different situations. (c) 2022

Abstract = {This article discusses the phenomenon of ``context effects{''} by
   reviewing the findings and practices of a range of scientific fields,
   including astronomy, physics, biology, medicine. and especially the
   relevant research and theory from psychology. Context information, such
   as expectations about what one is supposed to see or conclude, has been
   found to have a small but relentless impact on human perception,
   judgment, and decision-making. The article then considers the
   vulnerability of forensic science practice to context effects, and
   concludes by suggesting that forensic science adopt practices familiar
   in other fields of scientific work. in particular blind or double-blind
   testing and also the use of evidence line-ups.},

Abstract = {The birth and decline of disciplines are critical to science and
   society. How do scientific disciplines emerge? No quantitative model to
   date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of
   endogenous processes, such as social collaborations, and exogenous
   events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based
   model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social
   interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge
   from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration
   network. We find that this social model can account for a number of
   stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars,
   and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for
   the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science.
   While several ``science of science'' theories exist, this is the first
   account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis
   of empirical data.},

Abstract = {pSTEM fields (Physical Sciences, Technology, Engineering and
   Mathematics) are known for showing a gender imbalance favouring men.
   This imbalance can be seen at several levels, including in university
   and industry, where men are the majority of the posts. Academic success
   is partly dependent on the value of the researchers' co-authorship
   networks. One of the ways to enrich one's network is through academic
   movement; the change of institutions in search of better opportunities
   within the same country or internationally. In this paper, we look at
   the data for one specific pSTEM field, Computer Science, and describe
   the productivity and co-authorship patterns that emerge as a function of
   academic mobility. We find that women and men both benefit from national
   and international mobility, women who never change affiliations over
   their career are rarely well-cited or highly productive, and women are
   not well-represented in the overall top-ranking researchers.},

Abstract = {Questionable publications have been accused of ``greedy `` practices;
   however, their influence on academia has not been gauged. Here, we probe
   the impact of questionable publications through a systematic and
   comprehensive analysis with various participants from academia and
   compare the results with those of their unaccused counterparts using
   billions of citation records, including liaisons, i.e., journals and
   publishers, and prosumers, i.e., authors. Questionable publications
   attribute publisher-level self-citations to their journals while
   limiting journal-level self-citations; yet, conventional journal-level
   metrics are unable to detect these publisher-level self-citations. We
   propose a hybrid journal-publisher metric for detecting self-favouring
   citations among QJs from publishers. Additionally, we demonstrate that
   the questionable publications were less disruptive and influential than
   their counterparts. Our findings indicate an inflated citation impact of
   suspicious academic publishers. The findings provide a basis for
   actionable policy-making against questionable publications.},

Abstract = {Quantitative analysis of knowledge content of a significant
   technological innovation is a novel approach to understand the
   scientific discovery process. Here we describe such an analysis applied
   to the invention of recombinant DNA technology in the early 1970's. Two
   focal papers are selected, i.e., Jackson a al., 1972 and Cohen a al.,
   1973. A knowledge framework called EApc is described to categorize
   knowledge types and their quantification. The focal papers, along with
   their reference lists, are used to determine the minimal scientific
   knowledge necessary for generating the notions central to each focal
   paper. Attempts are made to trace how each type of knowledge was
   generated by various research communities. The results are discussed in
   terms of their potential implications in measuring, evaluating,
   understanding and managing the scientific research process.},

Abstract = {Diversity in science is necessary to improve innovation and increase the
   capacity of the scientific workforce. Despite decades-long efforts to
   increase gender diversity, however, women remain a small minority in
   many fields, especially in senior positions. The dearth of elite women
   scientists, in turn, leaves fewer women to serve as mentors and role
   models for young women scientists. To shed light on gender disparities
   in science, we study prominent scholars who were elected to the National
   Academy of Sciences. We construct author citation networks that capture
   the structure of recognition among scholars' peers. We identify gender
   disparities in the patterns of peer citations and show that these
   differences are strong enough to accurately predict the scholar's
   gender. In contrast, we do not observe disparities due to prestige, with
   few significant differences in the structure of citations of scholars
   affiliated with high-ranked and low-ranked institutions. These results
   provide further evidence that a scholar's gender plays a role in the
   mechanisms of success in science.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},

Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Evaluating scholars' achievements is an important problem in the science
   of science with applications in the evaluation of grant proposals and
   promotion applications. Since the number of scholars and the number of
   scholarly outputs grow exponentially with time, well-designed ranking
   metrics that have the potential to assist in these tasks are of prime
   importance. To rank scholars, it is important to put their achievements
   in perspective by comparing them with the achievements of other scholars
   active in the same period. We propose here a particular way of doing so:
   by computing the evaluated scholar's share on each year's citations
   which quantifies how the scholar fares in competition with the others.
   We assess the resulting ranking method using the American Physical
   Society citation data and four prestigious physics awards. Our results
   show that the new method significantly outperforms other ranking methods
   in identifying the prize laureates. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Luck is considered a crucial ingredient to achieve impact in all
   creative domains, despite their diversity. For instance, in science, the
   movie industry, music, and art, the occurrence of the highest impact
   work and a hot streak within a creative career are very difficult to
   predict. Are there domains that are more prone to luck than others?
   Here, we provide new insights on the role of randomness in impact in
   creative careers in two ways: (i) we systematically untangle luck and
   individual ability to generate impact in the movie, music, and book
   industries, and in science, and compare the luck factor between these
   fields; (ii) we show the surprising presence of randomness in the
   relationship between collaboration networks and timing of career hits.
   Taken together, our analysis suggests that luck consistently affects
   career impact across all considered sectors and improves our
   understanding in pinpointing the key elements in driving success.},

Abstract = {This letter aims to highlight severe inconsistencies in the scientific
   evaluation of regionally publicly funded research projects, uncovering
   structural failures related to the public management of science that go
   beyond technical aspects of bibliometrics. This problem is exemplified
   through an illustrative case study (the public grants program to
   emerging research groups funded by the regional government of the
   Valencian region, Spain, NUTS-2), describing three complementary aspects
   of this call (the evaluation system, the evaluation process, and the
   communication of the evaluation). The problems illustrated by this case
   study lead to a general problem related to the nonstrategic use of
   science. Finally, the national and international regularization of the
   professional activity of research evaluation in general, and
   bibliometrics in particular, is proposed as a route to avoid
   mismanagement of science (and scientific evaluation).},

Abstract = {According to a recent survey, ecologists and evolutionary biologists
   feel that theoretical and empirical research should coexist in a tight
   feedback loop but believe that the two domains actually interact very
   little. We evaluate this perception using a citation network analysis
   for two data sets, representing the literature on sexual selection and
   speciation. Overall, 54\%-60\% of citations come from a paper's own
   category, whereas 17\%-23\% are citations across categories. These
   cross-citations tend to focus on highly cited papers, and we observe a
   positive correlation between the numbers of citations a study receives
   within and across categories. We find evidence that reviews can function
   as integrators between the two literatures, argue that theoretical
   models are analogous to specific empirical study systems, and complement
   our analyses by studying a cocitation network. We conclude that
   theoretical and empirical research are more tightly connected than
   generally thought but that avenues exist to further increase this
   integration.},

Abstract = {A bibliometric analysis, updating Garfield's previous study of 1985,
   shows that Derek Price's Little science, big science (LSBS) has been
   cited on more than 1,500 occasions since its publication in 1963.
   Content analysis of these citations shows that Price's work has inspired
   the formation and subsequent development of several distinct communities
   of scholarly practice, including the history, sociology, politics and
   `science' of science. In library and information science, LSBS is best
   remembered for its model of the exponential growth of scientific
   literature. Recent scientometric work has demonstrated that other
   mathematical models may prove a better fit to data on the actual growth
   of the literature in various fields; of these alternatives, the power
   model is most commonly invoked as an all-purpose descriptor of growth
   processes in electronic communication systems such as the Web. Price's
   work thus retains its relevance, 40 years on, for the webometricians of
   today.},

Abstract = {Experience plays a critical role in crafting high-impact scientific
   work. This is particularly evident in top multidisciplinary journals,
   where a scientist is unlikely to appear as senior author if he or she
   has not previously published within the same journal. Here, we develop a
   quantitative understanding of author order by quantifying this
   ``chaperone effect,{''} capturing how scientists transition into senior
   status within a particular publication venue. We illustrate that the
   chaperone effect has a different magnitude for journals in different
   branches of science, being more pronounced in medical and biological
   sciences and weaker in natural sciences. Finally, we show that in the
   case of high-impact venues, the chaperone effect has significant
   implications, specifically resulting in a higher average impact relative
   to papers authored by new principal investigators (PIs). Our findings
   shed light on the role played by experience in publishing within
   specific scientific journals, on the paths toward acquiring the
   necessary experience and expertise, and on the skills required to
   publish in prestigious venues.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {238},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Quantifying and predicting the long-term impact of both scientific
   papers and individual authors have important implications for many
   academic policy decisions, from identifying emerging trends to assessing
   the merits of proposals for potential funding. This paper presents
   SI-HDGNN, a novel heterogeneous dynamical graph neural network that
   explicitly models a heterogeneous, weighted, directed and attributed
   academic graph, enabling a prediction of the cumulative scientific
   impact of papers and authors by a specifically designed aggregation
   method. Unlike the existing feature-based or homogeneous approaches,
   SI-HDGNN addresses the problem by capturing the temporal-structural
   characteristics of the papers and authors as well as their complex
   interactions and long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted
   on three large-scale multidisciplinary academic datasets demonstrate its
   superior performance in predicting the long-term scientific impact of
   both scientific papers and authors. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {As federal programs are held more accountable for their research
   investments, The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
   (NIEHS) has developed a new method to quantify the impact of our funded
   research on the scientific and broader communities. In this article we
   review traditional bibliometric analyses, address challenges associated
   with them, and describe a new bibliometric analysis method, the
   Automated Research Impact Assessment (ARIA). ARIA taps into a resource
   that has only rarely been used for bibliometric analyses: references
   cited in ``important{''} research artifacts, such as policies,
   regulations, clinical guidelines, and expert panel reports. The approach
   includes new statistics that science managers can use to benchmark
   contributions to research by funding source. This new method provides
   the ability to conduct automated impact analyses of federal research
   that can be incorporated in program evaluations. We apply this method to
   several case studies to examine the impact of NIEHS funded research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper aims to find the reasons why some citation models can predict
   a set of specific bib-liometric indices extremely well. We show why
   fitting a model that preserves the total sum of a vector can be
   beneficial in the case of heavy-tailed data that are frequently observed
   in informet-rics and similar disciplines. Based on this observation, we
   introduce the reparameterised versions of the discrete generalised beta
   distribution (DGBD) and power law models that preserve the total sum of
   elements in a citation vector and, as a byproduct, they enjoy much
   better predictive power when predicting many bibliometric indices as
   well as partial cumulative sums. This also results in the underlying
   model parameters' being easier to fit numerically. Moreover, they are
   also more interpretable. Namely, just like in our recently-introduced
   3DSI (three dimensions of scientific impact) model, we have a clear
   distinction between the coefficients determining the total pro-ductivity
   (size), total impact (sum), and those that affect the shape of the
   resulting theoretical curve.},

Abstract = {The reproducibility crisis triggered worldwide initiatives to improve
   rigor, reproducibility, and transparency in biomedical research. There
   are many examples of scientists, journals, and funding agencies adopting
   responsible research practices. The QUEST (Quality-Ethics-Open
   Science-Translation) Center offers a unique opportunity to examine the
   role of institutions. The Berlin Institute of Health founded QUEST to
   increase the likelihood that research conducted at this large academic
   medical center would be trustworthy, useful for scientists and society,
   and ethical. QUEST researchers perform ``science of science{''} studies
   to understand problems with standard practices and develop targeted
   solutions. The staff work with institutional leadership and local
   scientists to incentivize and support responsible practices in research,
   funding, and hiring. Some activities described in this paper focus on
   the institution, whereas others may benefit the national and
   international scientific community. Our experience, approaches, and
   recommendations will be informative for faculty leadership,
   administrators, and researchers interested in improving scientific
   practice.},

Abstract = {Research, the manufacture of knowledge, is currently practiced largely
   as an ``art,{''}not a ``science.{''} Just as science (understanding) and
   technology (tools) have revolutionized the manufacture of other goods
   and services, it is natural, perhaps inevitable, that they will
   ultimately also be applied to the manufacture of knowledge. In this
   article, we present an emerging perspective on opportunities for such
   application, at three different levels of the research enterprise. At
   the cognitive science level of the individual researcher, opportunities
   include: overcoming idea fixation and sloppy thinking, and balancing
   divergent and convergent thinking. At the social network level of the
   research team, opportunities include: overcoming strong links and
   groupthink, and optimally distributing divergent and convergent thinking
   between individuals and teams. At the research ecosystem level of the
   research institution and the larger national and international community
   of researchers, opportunities include: overcoming performance fixation,
   overcoming narrow measures of research impact, and overcoming (or
   harnessing) existential/social stress.},

Abstract = {We characterize the temporal dynamics of Scientific Fitness, as defined
   by the Economic Fitness and Complexity (EFC) framework, and R\&D
   expenditures at the geographic scale of nations. Our analysis highlights
   common patterns across similar research systems, and shows how
   develop-ing nations (China in particular) are quickly catching up with
   the developed world. This paints the picture of a general growth of
   scientific and technical capabilities of nations induced by the
   spreading of information typical of the scientific environment. Shifting
   the focus of the analysis to the regional level, we find that even
   developed nations display a considerable level of inequal-ity in the
   Scientific Fitness of their internal regions. Further, we assess
   comparatively how the competitiveness of each geographic region is
   distributed over the spectrum of research sectors. Overall, the
   Scientific Fitness represents the first high quality estimation of the
   scientific strength of nations and regions, opening new policy-making
   applications for better allocating resources, filling inequality gaps
   and ultimately promoting innovation.},

Abstract = {The development of modern electronics was to a large extent related to
   the advent and popularization of bipolar junction technology. The
   present work applies science of science concepts and methodologies in
   order to develop a relatively systematic, quantitative study of the
   development of electronics from a bipolar-junction perspective. First,
   we searched the adopted dataset (Microsoft Academic Graph) for entries
   related to ``bipolar junction transistor''. Community detection was then
   applied in order to derive sub-areas, which were tentatively labeled
   into 10 overall groups. This modular graph was then studied from several
   perspectives, taking into account topological measurements as well as
   time evolution. A number of interesting results are reported, including
   a good level of thematic coherence within each identified area, as well
   as the identification of distinct periods over time including the onset
   and coming of age of bipolar junction technology and related areas. A
   particularly surprising result was the verification of a particularly
   stable interrelationship between the identified areas along time. (C)

Abstract = {This study presents a mixed model that combines different indicators to
   describe and predict key structural and dynamic features of emerging
   research areas. Three indicators are combined: sudden increases in the
   frequency of specific words; the number and speed by which new authors
   are attracted to an emerging research area, and changes in the
   interdisciplinarity of cited references. The mixed model is applied to
   four emerging research areas: RNAi, Nano, h-Index, and Impact Factor
   research using papers published in the Proceedings of the National
   Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (1982-2009) and in
   Scientometrics (1978-2009). Results are compared in terms of strengths
   and temporal dynamics. Results show that the indicators are indicative
   of emerging areas and they exhibit interesting temporal correlations:
   new authors enter the area first, then the interdisciplinarity of paper
   references increases, then word bursts occur. All workflows are reported
   in a manner that supports replication and extension by others.},

   public hold views differing from those of most scientists, and they
   often do not support proposals based on the scientists' views. The
   overall cultural authority of science has also been challenged in the
   last decade by several negative trends in the sciences themselves,
   including widely-reported cases of fraud and failures in replication.
   With the support of professional science organizations, science
   communication specialists have stepped in aggressively to address
   science's communication problems scientifically. This paper will examine
   the assumptions behind their advice on scientific information, their
   recommended strategies of framing, narration, and projecting
   trustworthiness, and their characterizations of audiences and the nature
   of science itself. From the perspective of rhetorical argumentation, the
   science communication literature does not promote addressing audiences
   as citizens capable of rational argumentation. But thescience of science
   communicationis likely to remain the dominant approach to public science
   with the professional science community.},

Abstract = {The understanding of the inner workings of a research community is
   essential for the success of an author's academic publications. One of
   the key metrics for the evaluation of researchers is the number of
   citations that their publications receive. To understand citation
   behavior of an academic community, existing publication's citations can
   be studied.
   In this paper, we analyze whether several factors influence the number
   of citations in the domain of covert channels/steganography (CC/St). In
   particular, we study the significant differences on average yearly
   citations received by journal, conference and workshop publications. We
   also analyze the influence of tier-levels, number of references, number
   of pages, type of contribution, and number of authors on the average
   yearly citations. Our study is based on the meta-data of 1,531
   publications on CC/St and 8,391 publications on other topics of
   information security extracted from IEEEXplore as well as on 110
   publications' meta-data from Google Scholar.},

Abstract = {The science and engineering workforce has aged rapidly in recent years,
   both in absolute terms and relative to the workforce as a whole. This is
   a potential concern if the large number of older scientists crowds out
   younger scientists, making it difficult for them to establish
   independent careers. In addition, scientists are believed to be most
   creative earlier in their careers, so the aging of the workforce may
   slow the pace of scientific progress. We develop and simulate a
   demographic model, which shows that a substantial majority of recent
   aging is a result of the aging of the large baby boom cohort of
   scientists. However, changes in behavior have also played a significant
   role, in particular, a decline in the retirement rate of older
   scientists, induced in part by the elimination of mandatory retirement
   in universities in 1994. Furthermore, the age distribution of the
   scientific workforce is still adjusting. Current retirement rates and
   other determinants of employment in science imply a steady-state mean
   age 2.3 y higher than the 2008 level of 48.6.},

Title = {Statistical regularities in the rank-citation profile of scientists},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Recent science of science research shows that scientific impact measures
   for journals and individual articles have quantifiable regularities
   across both time and discipline. However, little is known about the
   scientific impact distribution at the scale of an individual scientist.
   We analyze the aggregate production and impact using the rank-citation
   profile c(i)(r) of 200 distinguished professors and 100 assistant
   professors. For the entire range of paper rank r, we fit each c(i)(r) to
   a common distribution function. Since two scientists with equivalent
   Hirsch h-index can have significantly different c(i)(r) profiles, our
   results demonstrate the utility of the beta(i) scaling parameter in
   conjunction with h(i) for quantifying individual publication impact. We
   show that the total number of citations C-i tallied from a scientist's
   N-i papers scales as C-i similar to h(i)(1+beta i). Such statistical

Title = {Towards theorizing peer review},
Journal = {QUANTITATIVE SCIENCE STUDIES},

Abstract = {Academic peer review is seriously undertheorized because peer review
   studies focus on discovering and confirming phenomena, such as biases,
   and are much less concerned with explaining, predicting, or controlling
   phenomena on a theoretical basis. In this paper, I therefore advocate
   for more theorizing in research on peer review. I first describe the
   main characteristics of the peer review literature, which focuses mainly
   on journal and grant peer review. Based on these characteristics, I then
   argue why theory is useful in research on peer review, and I present
   some theoretical efforts on peer review. I conclude by encouraging peer
   review researchers to be more theoretically engaged and outline
   activities that theoretical work on peer review could involve. This
   invitation to theory-building complements recent roadmaps and calls that
   have emphasized that we need to have better access to peer review data,
   improve research design and statistical analysis in peer review studies,
   experiment with innovative approaches to peer review, and provide more
   funding for peer review research.},

Abstract = {The influence of authors is mostly based on their capacity to form
   specific self-contained and/or active research communities or topics
   while also inspiring fruitful spin-off research derived from those
   communities or topics. Accurately estimating author influence and its
   indirect effect in inspiring external research creativity must thus be
   based on very precise community roles as well as topic-role analysis on
   citing material. In this paper we thus implement, compare, and combine
   two different kinds of knowledge mapping approaches used to track
   authors' influence over time-a recent topic-based mapping approach and
   an original hybrid community-based mapping approach. The experimental
   context of our study is the analysis of the dynamics and of the
   influence of the research of Prof. Liu Zeyuan, the most important
   contributor in the field of Science of Science in China. This analysis
   focuses on papers citing Professor Liu Zeyuan's research and highlights
   the full extent of his creative thinking.},

Abstract = {Research publishing companies need to constantly monitor and compare
   scientific journals and conferences in order to inform critical business
   and editorial decisions. Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph technologies
   are natural solutions since they allow these companies to integrate,
   represent, and analyse a large quantity of information from
   heterogeneous sources. In this paper, we present the AIDA Dashboard 2.0,
   an innovative system developed in collaboration with Springer Nature to
   analyse and compare scientific venues, now also available to the public.
   This tool builds on a knowledge graph which includes over 1.5B RDF
   triples and was produced by integrating information about 25M research
   articles from Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions, DBpedia, GRID, CSO,
   and INDUSO. It can produce sophisticated analytics and rankings that are
   not available in alternative systems. We discuss the advantages of this
   solution for the Springer Nature editorial process and present a user
   study involving 5 editors and 5 researchers, which yielded excellent
   results in terms of quality of the analytics and usability.},

Abstract = {Scientific datasets are increasingly crucial for knowledge accumulation
   and reproducibility, making it essential to understand how they are
   used. Although usage information is hard to obtain, features from the
   publications that describe a dataset can provide clues. This article
   associates dataset downloads with the authors' h-index, institutional
   prestige, journal ranking, and the references used in the publication
   that first introduces them. Tens of thousands of datasets and associated
   publications from figshare.com are used in our analysis. We found that a
   gradient boosting model achieved the highest performance against linear
   regression, random forests, and artificial neural networks. Our
   interpretation results suggest that journal ranking is highly predictive
   of usage while the author's institutional prestige and h-index are less
   critical. In addition, we found that publications with a long but
   focused body of references are associated with more dataset downloads.
   We also show that prediction performance decays rapidly the farther we
   estimate downloads into the future. Finally, we discuss the implications
   of our work for reproducibility and data policies.},

Abstract = {The ways in which we collect health and social data, particularly data
   on vulnerable and underprivileged populations, is enormously influential
   over the quality and content of science and health communication. Data
   absenteeism-the absence or limits of data on groups experiencing social
   vulnerability-is endemic; and as a result, inferences drawn from studies
   with absentee data are questionable. Reasons for data absenteeism
   include tendencies toward conventional recruitment of the subjects in
   research, the ways in which communities are engaged or not engaged in
   the research process, and a lack of understanding and appreciation of
   the lived reality of the socially vulnerable. The ``hardly reached{''}
   are often labelled ``hard to reach,{''} keeping this critical population
   out of view. One approach to mitigate data absenteeism is to engage key
   stakeholders of the community and its residents in the entire research
   process from design to dissemination, which influences how research
   questions are asked and answered and how research gets used. We argue
   for a more inclusive science of science communication to promote
   diversity and equity.},

Abstract = {Even though computer science (CS) has had a historical lack of gender
   and race representation, its AI research affects everybody eventually.
   Being partially rooted in CS conferences, ``AI ethics{''} (ATE)
   conferences such as FAccT and AIES have quickly become distinct venues
   where AI's societal implications are discussed and solutions proposed.
   However, it is largely unknown if these conferences improve upon the
   historical representational issues of traditional CS venues. In this
   work, we explore AIE conferences' evolution and compare them across
   demographic characteristics, publication content, and citation patterns.
   We find that AIE conferences have increased their internal topical
   diversity and impact on other CS conferences. Importantly, AIE
   conferences are highly differentiable, covering topics not represented
   in other venues. However, and perhaps contrary to the field's
   aspirations, white authors are more common while seniority and black
   researchers are represented similarly to CS venues. Our results suggest
   that AIE conferences could increase efforts to attract more diverse
   authors, especially considering their sizable roots in CS.},

Abstract = {The reader is invited to the last interview of an outstanding scientist
   and organizer of science, academician Boris E. Paton to the journal
   ``Science and Science of Science{''} (Kiev, Ukraine). While the
   interview was being prepared for publication, Boris Paton was gone.
   Thus, the interview became a kind of testament to the entire scientific
   community and leaders of states. For almost six decades Boris E. Paton
   headed The National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Having vast
   experience and having gone through several historical epochs,
   Academician Paton proposed the program for getting Ukrainian science out
   of the crisis. Many of his proposals are applicable to Russian science,
   which is going through a difficult period of reform.
   The interview originally was published in Ukrainian language. The
   published text is the first full version of the interview in Russian.
   The interview is preceded by a short introduction by Corresponding
   Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Yu.M. Baturin, who knew
   academician Boris E. Paton well and interviewed him several times.},

Abstract = {The experimental studies presented here investigated whether discussing
   ethical implications of preliminary scientific results in a science blog
   would impact blog readers' perception of the responsible scientist
   blogger's epistemic trustworthiness (on the dimensions expertise,
   integrity, and benevolence). They also investigated whether it made a
   difference in who had brought forward the ethics aspects: the
   responsible scientist blogger or another expert. Results indicate that
   by the mere introduction of ethics, people infer something about the
   blogger's communicative intentions: Introducing ethical aspects seems to
   raise vigilance about an expert's benevolence and integrity. Moreover,
   ratings of epistemic trustworthiness differed depending on who added
   ethical arguments: If ethics were introduced by the scientist blogger
   himself, his benevolence and integrity were rated higher than when
   ethics were introduced by another expert. These results are relevant for
   science bloggers, science communicators, and researchers who study
   laypeople's understanding of epistemic uncertainty within science.},

Abstract = {It has been a quarter of a century since the publication of the first
   edition of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Supported
   Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD) held in 1996 in Beijing, China.
   Despite some attempts to empirically examine the evolution and identity
   of the field of CSCW and its related communities and disciplines, the
   scarcity of scientometric studies on the IEEE CSCWD research
   productivity is noteworthy. To fill this gap, this study reports on an
   exploratory quantitative analysis of the literature published in the
   IEEE CSCWD conference proceedings with the purpose of visualizing and
   understanding its structure and evolution for the 2001-2019 period. The
   findings offer valuable insights into the paper and author distribution,
   country and citation-level productivity indicators, degree of
   collaboration, and collaboration index. Through this analysis we also
   expect to get an initial overview of the IEEE CSCWD conference
   concerning the main topics being presented, most cited papers, and
   variances in the number of keywords, full-text views, and references.},

Abstract = {Scientists collaborate through intricate networks, which impact the
   quality and scope of their research. At the same time, funding and
   institutional arrangements, as well as scientific and political
   cultures, affect the structure of collaboration networks. Since such
   arrangements and cultures differ across regions in the world in
   systematic ways, we surmise that collaboration networks and impact
   should also differ systematically across regions. To test this, we
   compare the structure of collaboration networks among prominent
   researchers in North America and Europe. We find that prominent
   researchers in Europe establish denser collaboration networks, whereas
   those in North America establish more decentralized networks. We also
   find that the impact of the publications of prominent researchers in
   North America is significantly higher than for those in Europe, both
   when they collaborate with other prominent researchers and when they do
   not. Although Europeans collaborate with other prominent researchers
   more often, which increases their impact, we also find that repeated
   collaboration among prominent researchers decreases the synergistic
   effect of collaborating.},

Abstract = {As teams become prevalent in contemporary science, how to establish
   collaborations is key to tomorrow's breakthrough, which has broad
   implications to individual scientists, institutions, and funding
   agencies. In this paper, we focus on the association between
   collaboration networks and scientists producing novel and disruptive
   research, based on the publication data from the American Physical
   Society. In particular, we focus on the role of spanning structural
   holes on producing novel and disruptive research. Our primary finding is
   that scientists whose collaboration networks span over structural holes
   in their collaboration networks not only produce more novel and
   disruptive research, but also have higher chance to produce novel and
   disruptive research. Although both male and female scientists benefit
   from structural holes, we find suggestive evidence that female
   researchers benefit more. This paper provides empirical evidence on the
   relationship between structural holes and novel/disruptive research in
   the field of physics, which has policy implications for nurturing
   scientists and developing science policies.},

Abstract = {We map the topic structure of psychology utilizing a sample of over
   500,000 abstracts of research articles and conference proceedings
   spanning two decades (1995-2015). To do so, we apply structural topic
   models to examine three research questions: (i) What are the
   discipline's most prevalent research topics? (ii) How did the scientific
   discourse in psychology change over the last decades, especially since
   the advent of neurosciences? (iii) And was this change carried by high
   impact (HI) or less prestigious journals? Our results reveal that topics
   related to natural sciences are trending, while their `counterparts'
   leaning to humanities are declining in popularity. Those trends are even
   more pronounced in the leading outlets of the field. Furthermore, our
   findings indicate a continued interest in methodological topics
   accompanied by the ascent of neurosciences and related methods and
   technologies (e.g. fMRI's). At the same time, other established
   approaches (e.g. psychoanalysis) become less popular and indicate a
   relative decline of topics related to the social sciences and the
   humanities.},

Abstract = {Immunology and microbiology research are essential for human and animal
   health. Unlike many other health fields, they do not usually centre
   around the curing or helping individual patients but focus on the
   microscopic scale instead. These fields are interesting from a gender
   perspective because two theories seeking to explain gender differences
   in career choices in the USA (people/things and communal/agentic goals)
   might produce conflicting expectations about their gender balances. This
   article assesses the gender shares of journal articles and gendered
   citation rates of five subfields of the Scopus Immunology and
   Microbiology broad category 1996-2014/18, for research with solely US
   author affiliations. Only Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (38\%
   female) had not reached gender parity in publishing by 2018. There was a
   female first author citation advantage in Parasitology but a
   disadvantage in Immunology. Immunology, Parasitology and Virology, had
   female last author citation disadvantages, but all gender effects were
   much smaller (<5\%) than that of an extra author (10\%-56\%). Citation
   differences cannot therefore account for the current underrepresentation
   of women in senior roles.},

Abstract = {In response to the call for a science of science policy, we discuss the
   contribution of indicators at the macro-level of nations from a
   scientometric perspective. In addition to global trends such as the rise
   of China, one can relate percentages of world share of publications to
   government expenditure in academic research. The marginal costs of
   improving one's share are increasing over time. Countries differ
   considerably in terms of the efficiency of turning ( financial) input
   into bibliometrically measurable output. Both funding schemes and
   disciplinary portfolios differ among countries. A price per paper can
   nevertheless be estimated. The percentages of GDP spent on academic
   research in different nations are significantly correlated to historical
   contingencies such as the percentage of researchers in the population.
   The institutional dynamics make strategic objectives such as the Lisbon
   objective of the EU - that is, spending 3\% of GDP for R\&D in 2010 -
   unrealistic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Looking back over three decades of work on public understanding (and
   communication) of science, I revisit four areas in which our field has
   been unnecessarily stagnant, but that also provide exciting
   opportunities for our field to meaningfully guide what will be
   critically important global debates surrounding emerging technologies
   moving forward: (1) letting go of deficit-type thinking among scholars
   and practitioners, focused on misinformation or other perceived
   informational asymmetries; (2) resisting the temptation to try and cure
   what the scientific community often dismisses as public (opinion)
   pathologies; (3) using a scientific approach to science communication as
   the foundation of a changing culture of public-minded science; and (4)
   acknowledging that solutions to the challenges posed by deeply
   disruptive applications of technologies like AI will not be solved by
   ethicists, affected communities, social scientists, STEM scientists,
   activists, journalists or policy makers alone. Emerging science will
   force societies to build capacity for communication and decision making
   across all of these stakeholder groups.},

Title = {A dataset of publication records for Nobel laureates},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {A central question in the science of science concerns how to develop a
   quantitative understanding of the evolution and impact of individual
   careers. Over the course of history, a relatively small fraction of
   individuals have made disproportionate, profound, and lasting impacts on
   science and society. Despite a long-standing interest in the careers of
   scientific elites across diverse disciplines, it remains difficult to
   collect large-scale career histories that could serve as training sets
   for systematic empirical and theoretical studies. Here, by combining
   unstructured data collected from CVs, university websites, and
   Wikipedia, together with the publication and citation database from
   Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), we reconstructed publication histories
   of nearly all Nobel prize winners from the past century, through both
   manual curation and algorithmic disambiguation procedures. Data
   validation shows that the collected dataset presents among the most
   comprehensive collection of publication records for Nobel laureates
   currently available. As our quantitative understanding of science
   deepens, this dataset is expected to have increasing value. It will not
   only allow us to quantitatively probe novel patterns of productivity,
   collaboration, and impact governing successful scientific careers, it
   may also help us unearth the fundamental principles underlying
   creativity and the genesis of scientific breakthroughs.},

Journal = {BIG DATA RESEARCH},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world. With the growing
   attention on the deadly pandemic, discussions and research on COVID-19
   are rapidly increasing to exchange latest findings with the hope to
   accelerate the pace of finding a cure. As a branch of information
   technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has greatly expedited the
   development of human society. In this paper, we investigate and
   visualize the on-going advancements of early scientific research on
   COVID-19 from the perspective of AI. By adopting the Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) model, this paper allocates the research articles into
   50 key research topics pertinent to COVID-19 according to their
   abstracts. We present an overview of early studies of the COVID-19
   crisis at different scales including referencing/citation behavior,
   topic variation and their inner interactions. We also identify
   innovative papers that are regarded as the cornerstones in the
   development of COVID-19 research. The results unveil the focus of
   scientific research, thereby giving deep insights into how the academic
   society contributes to combating the COVID-19 pandemic. (C) 2021

Abstract = {References formulate the foundation and endorsements of scientific
   research. Using articles pub-lished in 2005 covered by Microsoft
   Academic Graph, the current paper defines and calculates five indicators
   of references, i.e., the number of references, the number of citations
   of references, the age of references, the number of nodes in a reference
   cascade (a multi-generation reference network), and the density of
   bibliographic coupling networks by references, and investigates their
   relations with the citation impact of the focal publication. A
   non-linear relationship is shown in all the five indicators;
   specifically, we observe two types of patterns, namely inverted-L and-U
   relations, both presenting the existence of critical points. We further
   explore the discipline-level differences of such a relationship and how
   it relates to the characteristics of the discipline itself. Among all
   five indicators, the effect of disciplinary academic ``environments ``
   is universally iden-tified. We believe that the current paper provides
   insightful views to the discussion regarding the significance of a
   reference list.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, a relatively small number of individuals have made a
   profound and lasting impact on science and society. Despite
   long-standing, multi-disciplinary interests in understanding careers of
   elite scientists, there have been limited attempts for a quantitative,
   career-level analysis. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset we
   assembled, allowing us to trace the entire career histories of nearly
   all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine
   over the past century. We find that, although Nobel laureates were
   energetic producers from the outset, producing works that garner
   unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize follow
   relatively similar patterns to those of ordinary scientists, being
   characterized by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations.
   We also uncovered notable variations along their careers, often
   associated with the Nobel Prize, including shifting coauthorship
   structure in the prize-winning work, and a significant but temporary dip
   in the impact of work they produce after winning the Nobel Prize.
   Together, these results document quantitative patterns governing the
   careers of scientific elites, offering an empirical basis for a deeper
   understanding of the hallmarks of exceptional careers in science.},

Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Research collaboration, a ubiquitous phenomenon marking the increasing
   stratification of science, is hailed for its intellectual and societal
   benefits. Being an essential element of the economics of science, it has
   become a matter of scientific inquiry attracting efforts from fields as
   different as network analysis and bibliometrics. The studies have
   provided insights into the local structure of collaboration networks,
   relations between the team composition and research impact. However, the
   laws governing research collaboration at the (macro)scale of countries
   and institutions are yet to be established. In this work, a simple yet
   unexpectedly accurate logarithmic relation between measures of the
   research output and self-reliance is demonstrated. Restriction of
   co-authorship analysis to high-ranking journals suppresses geographical
   and cultural differences to expose universalities in the international
   research collaboration. The emerging law holds across research areas; it
   benchmarks collaboration patterns of research institutions grouped by
   type or country. The self-organized regularity of the collaboration
   dynamics manifests an important role of national research systems in
   globalized science, may have profound implications for research policy
   development and implementation. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The impact of peer review on the contribution potential of scientific
   papers},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The peer-reviewing process has long been regarded as an indispensable
   tool in ensuring the quality of a scientific publication. While previous
   studies have tried to understand the process as a whole, not much effort
   has been devoted to investigating the determinants and impacts of the
   content of the peer review itself. This study leverages open data from
   nearly 5,000 PeerJ publications that were eventually accepted. Using
   sentiment analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling,
   mixed linear regression models, and logit regression models, we examine
   how the peer-reviewing process influences the acceptance timeline and
   contribution potential of manuscripts, and what modifications were
   typically made to manuscripts prior to publication. In an open review
   paradigm, our findings indicate that peer reviewers' choice to reveal
   their names in lieu of remaining anonymous may be associated with more
   positive sentiment in their review, implying possible social pressure
   from name association. We also conduct a taxonomy of the manuscript
   modifications during a revision, studying the words added in response to
   peer reviewer feedback. This study provides insights into the content of
   peer reviews and the subsequent modifications authors make to their
   manuscripts.},

Abstract = {Questionnaires are a device to elicit human perspectives, self-reports
   or knowledge. This article investigates which broad academic fields use
   questionnaires, whether this use is increasing, and whether it generates
   average citation impact. This is investigated through a nonprobability
   sample: articles mentioning questionnaires in their titles, abstracts,
   or keywords. This procedure captures a minority of research using
   questionnaires, with substantial biases against fields using alternative
   terminology, such as `instrument' or `survey', or that rarely explicitly
   mention questionnaires in titles, abstract or keywords because they play
   a minor role. The results suggest that the proportion of journal
   articles using questionnaires tripled between 1996 and 2019, and this
   proportion increased in all 27 broad Scopus fields. Over the same
   period, the citation impact of the identified research declined from
   above average to below average. Thus, whilst academic research seems to
   be increasingly using questionnaires, the quality or scholarly value of
   research using questionnaires may be declining. These are tentative
   conclusions because of the unknown sampling bias for the set of
   questionnaire-based articles analysed.},

Abstract = {We study how a single paper affects the impact factor (IF) of a journal
   by analyzing data from 3,088,511 papers published in 11639 journals in
   the 2017 Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics. We find that
   IFs are highly volatile. For example, the top-cited paper of 381
   journals caused their IF to increase by more than 0.5 points, while for
   818 journals the relative increase exceeded 25\%. One in 10 journals had
   their IF boosted by more than 50\% by their top three cited papers.
   Because the single-paper effect on the IF is inversely proportional to
   journal size, small journals are rewarded much more strongly than large
   journals for a highly cited paper, while they are penalized more for a
   low-cited paper, especially if their IF is high. This skewed reward
   mechanism incentivizes high-IF journals to stay small to remain
   competitive in rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough
   papers appearing in prestigious journals. We question the reliability of
   IF rankings given the high IF sensitivity to a few papers that affects
   thousands of journals.},

Abstract = {In Japanese pharmaceutical community, there seems to be a lack of
   ``Science of Science{''} and ``Research on Research{''} which are to
   utilize unit sciences and research for the benefit of human being. In
   other words, pharmaceutical people in Japan should have much more
   pharmaceutical philosophy. The late Professor Komei Miyaki, founder
   Editor-in-Chief of FARUMASHIA, the monthly membership magazine of
   Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, under whom I worked as one of editorial
   board members, taught me that scientists should have their own
   philosophy of their sciences. Such a pharmaceutical philosophy as
   mentioned above should be established on the basis of complete
   separation of medical profession between doctors and pharmacists, which
   form the most important and necessary issue in safety assurance for
   patients with the complete zero defect (ZD action), as there is a long
   history for that in Europe since the separation was completed by King
   Friedrich II in 1240. Therefore, we have to learn the social status of
   European/American pharmacist practitioners who are the great No. 1 among
   all the professions. European pharmacists guarantee the safety of every
   chemical used for human body and pets, such as medicines, cosmetics,
   foods, tooth stuffs and so on. Regarding the pharmaceutical sciences in
   Japan also there seems to be a lack of pharmaceutical philosophy, as
   pharmaceutical scientists have no identity in research object that may
   be similar to basic scientists who are non-pharmacy graduates. Japanese
   sciences generally have developed along the lines of the Western model,
   reaching the current high level. We now not only should receive profits
   from the outside but also should embark on a mission to support
   pharmaceutical sciences throughout the world, especially Asian
   courtiers. At the present, we do not seem to be fulfilling our mission
   to do that, even though general activity includes significant
   international exchange. We have to make much more effort for
   international contribution/participation. For that, the most important
   and necessary issue is to make change in fundamental sense in Japanese
   pharmaceutical community, though an internationalization of
   technological issues is usually taken into consideration. In this
   connection, regarding the new drug development, we must have a change in
   the sense to establish pharmaceutical philosophy and jump up in
   conception from the existing one. Based on the above mentioned
   pharmaceutical philosophy, seven star pharmacists should be educated as
   described in 2000 FIP Statement of Policy: Good Pharmacy Education
   Practice, who could be a (1) care giver; (2) decision maker; (3)
   communicator; (4) leader; (5) manager; (6) life-long learner; (7)
   teacher.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we classify scientific articles in the domain of natural
   language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), as core subfields
   of artificial intelligence (AI), into whether (i) they extend the
   current state-of-the-art by the introduction of novel techniques which
   beat existing models or whether (ii) they mainly criticize the existing
   state-of-the-art, i.e. that it is deficient with respect to some
   property (e.g. wrong evaluation, wrong datasets, misleading task
   specification). We refer to contributions under (i) as having a
   `positive stance' and contributions under (ii) as having a `negative
   stance' (to related work). We annotate over 1.5 k papers from NLP and ML
   to train a SciBERT-based model to automatically predict the stance of a
   paper based on its title and abstract. We then analyse large-scale
   trends on over 41 k papers from the last approximately 35 years in NLP
   and ML, finding that papers have become substantially more positive over
   time, but negative papers also got more negative and we observe
   considerably more negative papers in recent years. Negative papers are
   also more influential in terms of citations they receive.},

Abstract = {Classifying scientific articles, patents, and other documents according
   to the relevant research topics is an important task, which enables a
   variety of functionalities, such as categorising documents in digital
   libraries, monitoring and predicting research trends, and recommending
   papers relevant to one or more topics. In this paper, we present the
   latest version of the CSO Classifier (v3.0), an unsupervised approach
   for automatically classifying research papers according to the Computer
   Science Ontology (CSO), a comprehensive taxonomy of research areas in
   the field of Computer Science. The CSO Classifier takes as input the
   textual components of a research paper (usually title, abstract, and
   keywords) and returns a set of research topics drawn from the ontology.
   This new version includes a new component for discarding outlier topics
   and offers improved scalability. We evaluated the CSO Classifier on a
   gold standard of manually annotated articles, demonstrating a
   significant improvement over alternative methods. We also present an
   overview of applications adopting the CSO Classifier and describe how it
   can be adapted to other fields.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal micro-data derived from transaction level information about
   wage and vendor payments made by Federal grants on multiple US campuses
   are being developed in a partnership involving researchers, university
   administrators, representatives of Federal agencies, and others. This
   paper describes the UMETRICS data initiative that has been implemented
   under the auspices of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. The
   resulting data set reflects an emerging conceptual framework for
   analyzing the process, products, and impact of research. It grows from
   and engages the work of a diverse and vibrant community. This paper
   situates the UMETRICS effort in the context of research evaluation and
   ongoing data infrastructure efforts in order to highlight its novel and
   valuable features. Refocusing data construction in this field around
   individuals, networks, and teams offers dramatic possibilities for data
   linkage, the evaluation of research investments, and the development of
   rigorous conceptual and empirical models. Two preliminary analyses of
   the scientific workforce and network approaches to characterizing
   scientific teams ground a discussion of future directions and a call for
   increased community engagement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Emergent patterns of collective attention towards scientists and their
   research may function as a proxy for scientific impact which
   traditionally is assessed via committees that award prizes to
   scientists. Therefore it is crucial to understand the relationships
   between scientific impact and online demand and supply for information
   about scientists and their work. In this paper, we compare the temporal
   pattern of information supply (article creations) and information demand
   (article views) on Wikipedia for two groups of scientists: scientists
   who received one of the most prestigious awards in their field and
   influential scientists from the same field who did not receive an award.
   Our research highlights that awards function as external shocks which
   increase supply and demand for information about scientists, but hardly
   affect information supply and demand for their research topics. Further,
   we find interesting differences in the temporal ordering of information
   supply between the two groups: (i) award-winners have a higher
   probability that interest in them precedes interest in their work; (ii)
   for award winners interest in articles about them and their work is
   temporally more clustered than for non-awarded scientists.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Roadmapping in China and in Germany has different connotations,
   contexts, meanings and cultural backgrounds. In order to understand what
   is meant by roadmaps - and not to confuse roadmaps with foresight in
   general a comparative analysis was jointly performed by the Beijing
   Research Centre for Science of Science (BRCSS) under the Beijing Academy
   of Science and Technology and the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and
   Innovation Research (ISI). This joint project investigated several cases
   according to a set of criteria and compared the content. The aim of the
   project was mutual learning and the results revealed that the
   differences can be found on different levels like the understanding of
   the terminology (not only language), cultural understandings, the
   background of the innovation system and contexts of the roadmaps and the
   understanding of the objectives. The way the process is performed

Abstract = {Articles in high-impact journals are, on average, more frequently cited.
   But are they cited more often because those articles are somehow more
   ``citable{''}? Or are they cited more often simply because they are
   published in a high-impact journal? Although some evidence suggests the
   latter, the causal relationship is not clear. We here compare citations
   of preprints to citations of the published version to uncover the causal
   mechanism. We build on an earlier model of citation dynamics to infer
   the causal effect of journals on citations. We find that high-impact
   journals select articles that tend to attract more citations. At the
   same time, we find that high-impact journals augment the citation rate
   of published articles. Our results yield a deeper understanding of the
   role of journals in the research system. The use of journal metrics in
   research evaluation has been increasingly criticized in recent years and
   article-level citations are sometimes suggested as an alternative. Our
   results show that removing impact factors from evaluation does not
   negate the influence of journals. This insight has important
   implications for changing practices of research evaluation.},

Title = {Author gender differences in psychology citation impact 1996-2018},

Abstract = {Academic psychology in the USA is a gender success story in terms of
   overturning its early male dominance but there are still relatively few
   senior female psychology researchers. To assess whether there are gender
   differences in citation impact that might help to explain either of
   these trends, this study investigates psychology articles since 1996.
   Seven out of eight Scopus psychology categories had a majority of female
   first-authored journal articles by 2018. From regression analyses of
   first and last author gender and team size, female first authors
   associate with a slightly higher average citation impact, but extra
   authors have a 10 times stronger association with higher average
   citation impact. Last author gender has little association with citation
   impact. Female first authors are more likely to be in larger teams and
   if team size is attributed to the first author's work, then their
   apparent influence of female first authors on citation impact doubles.
   While gender differences in average citation impact are too small to
   account for gender-related trends in academic psychology, they warn that
   male-dominated citation-based ranking lists of psychologists do not
   reflect the state of psychology research today.},

Abstract = {Scientometrics, an international journal focuses on quantitative aspects
   of the Science of Science, Communication in Science and Science Policy.
   Indian authors' contributions in the Scientometrics journal have been
   mapped to identify the authorship pattern and their scholarly
   communication behavior. During 1990 to 2017, Indian authors have
   published 208 articles including 29 international collaborative articles
   having avg. citations of 12.86 per article. The results have been
   critically studied on various aspects, namely, year wise, collaboration,
   authorship, productive institutions, leading authors, collaborating
   countries, popular keywords and citation. Further, different indices
   like h-index, A-index, i10-index and g-index have also been applied to
   determine the scholarly impact of publications. The highest numbers of
   articles are two-authored and the avg. authors per paper are 2.27. In
   addition, B.M. Gupta, the notable information scientist is the most
   prolific author and Belgium is the most productive foreign collaborating
   nation. The study proposes that the leading institutes like NISTADS,
   NISCAIR should start short-term courses in this area for enhancing
   capacity building and research performance of the Indian
   bibliometricians so that more quality papers may be produced in the
   thrust area.},

Abstract = {In November of 2017, an interdisciplinary panel discussed the
   complexities of gene drive applications as part of the third Sackler
   Colloquium on ``The Science of Science Communication.{''} The panel
   brought together a social scientist, life scientist, and journalist to
   discuss the issue from each of their unique perspectives. This paper
   builds on the ideas and conversations from the session to provide a more
   nuanced discussion about the context surrounding responsible
   communication and decision-making for cases of post-normal science.
   Deciding to use gene drives to control and suppress pests will involve
   more than a technical assessment of the risks involved, and responsible
   decision-making regarding their use will require concerted efforts from
   multiple actors. We provide a review of gene drives and their potential
   applications, as well as the role of journalists in communicating the
   extent of uncertainties around specific projects. We also discuss the
   roles of public opinion and online environments in public engagement
   with scientific processes. We conclude with specific recommendations
   about how to address current challenges and foster more effective
   communication and decision-making for complex, post-normal issues, such
   as gene drives.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the increasingly widespread view that Bourdieu's
   sociological analysis is flawed by excessive determinism and thus is
   anti-rationalist in its socio-political implications. Against this
   contention, it argues that works such as Distinction should be viewed as
   critiques of air absolutist universalism rather than of universalism as
   such. Moreover, Bourdieu's logic of practice, it is claimed, caters not
   only for a degree of autonomy at the level of the individual, but also
   identifies two key intellectual fields as pivotal cultural accumulators
   of autonomous or critical thought: the artistic field and the scientific
   field. In this context, it is particularly important that one of his
   very late works, Science of Science and Reflexivity, gives such a vital
   role to the free `corporation' of scientists as judges of scientific
   reputations. His concept of artistic autonomy is further explored by
   illustrations from case-studies in historical sociology, by writers who
   have been decisively influenced by his sociology of literature. The
   article ends with an application of his ideas to contemporary newspaper
   obituaries of cultural producers. This illuminates in particular an
   underlying issue in his sociology: current dangers to artistic autonomy.},

Abstract = {Human creativity is the ultimate driving force behind scientific
   progress. While the building blocks of innovations are often embodied in
   existing knowledge, it is creativity that blends seemingly disparate
   ideas. Existing studies have made striding advances in quantifying
   creativity of scientific publications by investigating their citation
   relationships. Yet, little is known hitherto about the underlying
   mechanisms governing scientific creative processes, largely due to that
   a paper's references, at best, only partially reflect its authors'
   actual information consumption. This work represents an initial step
   towards fine-grained understanding of creative processes in scientific
   enterprise. In specific, using two web-scale longitudinal datasets
   (120.1 million papers and 53.5 billion web requests spanning 4 years),
   we directly contrast authors' information consumption behaviors against
   their knowledge products. We find that, of 59.0\% papers across all
   scientific fields, 25.7\% of their creativity can be readily explained
   by information consumed by their authors. Further, by leveraging these
   findings, we develop a predictive framework that accurately identifies
   the most critical knowledge to fostering target scientific innovations.
   We believe that our framework is of fundamental importance to the study
   of scientific creativity. It promotes strategies to stimulate and
   potentially automate creative processes, and provides insights towards
   more effective designs of information recommendation platforms.},

Abstract = {Community detection techniques are widely used to infer hidden
   structures within interconnected systems. Despite demonstrating high
   accuracy on benchmarks, they reproduce the external classification for
   many real-world systems with a significant level of discrepancy. A
   widely accepted reason behind such outcome is the unavoidable loss of
   non-topological information (such as node attributes) encountered when
   the original complex system is converted to a network. In this article
   we systematically show that the observed discrepancies may also be
   caused by a different reason: the external classification itself. For
   this end we use scientific publication data which (i) exhibit a well
   defined modular structure and (ii) hold an expert-made classification of
   research articles. Having represented the articles and the extracted
   scientific concepts both as a bipartite network and as its unipartite
   projection, we applied modularity optimization to uncover the inner
   thematic structure. The resulting clusters are shown to partly reflect
   the author-made classification, although some significant discrepancies
   are observed. A detailed analysis of these discrepancies shows that they
   may carry essential information about the system, mainly related to the
   use of similar techniques and methods across different (sub)
   disciplines, that is otherwise omitted when only the external
   classification is considered.},

Abstract = {Finding dense bipartite subgraphs and detecting the relations among them
   is an important problem for affiliation networks that arise in a range
   of domains, such as social network analysis, word-document clustering,
   the science of science, internet advertising, and bioinformatics.
   However, most dense subgraph discovery algorithms are designed for
   classic, unipartite graphs. Subsequently, studies on affiliation
   networks are conducted on the co-occurrence graphs (e.g., co-author and
   co-purchase) that project the bipartite structure to a unipartite
   structure by connecting two entities if they share an affiliation.
   Despite their convenience, co-occurrence networks come at a cost of loss
   of information and an explosion in graph sizes, which limit the quality
   and the efficiency of solutions. We study the dense subgraph discovery
   problem on bipartite graphs. We define a framework of bipartite
   subgraphs based on the butterfly motif (2,2-biclique) to model the dense
   regions in a hierarchical structure. We introduce efficient peeling
   algorithms to find the dense subgraphs and build relations among them.
   We can identify denser structures compared to the state-of-the-art
   algorithms on co-occurrence graphs in real-world data. Our analyses on
   an author-paper network and a user-product network yield interesting
   subgraphs and hierarchical relations such as the groups of collaborators
   in the same institution and spammers that give fake ratings.},

Abstract = {The foundation of the scientific method rests on access to data, and yet
   such access is often restricted or costly. We investigate how improved
   data access shifts the quantity, quality, and diversity of scientific
   research. We examine the impact of reductions in cost and sharing
   restrictions for satellite imagery data from NASA's Landsat program (the
   longest record of remote-sensing observations of the Earth) on academic
   science using a sample of about 24,000 Landsat publications by over
   34,000 authors matched to almost 3,000 unique study locations. Analyses
   show that improved access had a substantial and positive effect on the
   quantity and quality of Landsat-enabled science. Improved data access
   also democratizes science by disproportionately helping scientists from
   the developing world and lower-ranked institutions to publish using
   Landsat data. This democratization in turn increases the geographic and
   topical diversity of Landsat-enabled research. Scientists who start
   using Landsat data after access is improved tend to focus on previously
   understudied regions close to their home location and introduce novel
   research topics. These findings suggest that policies that improve
   access to valuable scientific data may promote scientific progress,
   reduce inequality among scientists, and increase the diversity of
   scientific research.},

Abstract = {The advancement of science, as outlined by Popper and Kuhn, is largely
   qualitative, but with bibliometric data, it is possible and desirable to
   develop a quantitative picture of scientific progress. Furthermore, it
   is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that
   have the growth potential to accelerate the process from scientific
   breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address
   this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS
   data sets from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and
   co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters
   (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years,
   and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive
   features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year,
   we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs,
   i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging, and splitting. We found the
   number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and
   betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally,
   betweenness increased significantly for merging events and decreased
   significantly for splitting events. Our results represent the first step
   from a descriptive understanding of the science of science (SciSci),
   towards one that is ultimately prescriptive.},

Abstract = {Using big data has been a prevailing research trend in various academic
   fields. However, no studies have explored the scope and structure of big
   data across disciplines. In this article, we applied topic modeling and
   word co-occurrence analysis methods to identify key topics from more
   than 36,000 big data publications across all academic disciplines
   between 2012 and 2017. The results revealed several topics associated
   with the storage, collection and analysis of large datasets; the
   publications were predominantly published in computational fields. Other
   identified research topics show the influence of big data methods and
   techniques in areas beyond computer science, such as education, urban
   informatics, business, health and medical sciences. In fact, the
   prevalence of these topics has increased over time. In contrast, some
   themes like parallel computing, network modeling and big data analytic
   techniques have lost their popularity in recent years. These results
   probably reflect the maturity of big data core topics and highlight
   flourishing new research trends pertinent to big data in new domains,
   especially in social sciences, health and medicine. Findings of this
   article can be beneficial for researchers and science policymakers to
   understand the scope and structure of big data in different academic
   disciplines.},

Abstract = {Today, governments tackle the science of science policy with
   quantitative analysis, especially in the USA. This trend promotes the
   use of objective data by decision-makers in the fields of innovation
   policy and technology management. These decision-makers seek more
   reliable research and development at an earlier stage to contribute to
   the national economy. Under this worldwide trend, there is a high demand
   for quantitative analysis accompanying complex IT skills from
   governmental officers and non-IT researchers. The purpose of this
   research is to extract the destinations of currently growing fields of
   science by means of tracking citations and to capture signs of state of
   the art studies. The analysis data are bibliographic data of academic
   papers retrieved from Web of Science. I provide results for 16 growing
   topics as of July 2016. I deepen the understanding of the
   ``convolutional neural network'' among a lot of topics, and found future
   application candidates. I provide a methodology to discover future seeds
   of research and development. Additionally, the analysis system used in
   this research automatically publishes its results, and always provides
   the results. This research will contribute to improving strategies
   around research and development.},

Abstract = {The enormous increase in digital scholarly data and computing power
   combined with recent advances in text mining, linguistics, network
   science, and scientometrics make it possible to scientifically study the
   structure and evolution of science on a large scale. This paper
   discusses the challenges of this `BIG science of science' - also called
   `computational scientometrics' research - in terms of data access,
   algorithm scalability, repeatability, as well as result communication
   and interpretation. It then introduces two infrastructures: (1) the
   Scholarly Database (SDB) (http://sdb.slis.indiana.edu), which provides
   free online access to 20 million scholarly records papers, patents, and
   funding awards which can be cross-searched and downloaded as dumps, and
   (2) Scientometrics-relevant plug-ins of the open-source Network
   Workbench (NWB) Tool (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu). The utility of these
   infrastructures is then exemplarily demonstrated in three studies: a
   comparison of the funding portfolios and co-investigator networks of
   different universities, an examination of paper-citation and co-author
   networks of major network science researchers, and an analysis of topic
   bursts in streams of text. The paper concludes with a discussion of
   related work that aims to provide practically useful and theoretically
   grounded cyberinfrastructure in support of computational scientometrics
   research, practice, and education.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {25-35},
Abstract = {It is shown that the difficulties that appear during attempts to uncover
   the mechanisms of changing of scientific paradigms can be overcome by
   consistent application of the apparatus of dialectics and by the
   interpretation of science as a social institution that produces
   intangible assets. This in-terpretation demonstrates analogy between T.
   Kuhn's theory of changing scientific paradigms and the theory of
   innovation cycles, which goes back to the works of J. Schumpeter. The
   fact allows one to consider the production of intangible assets by the
   methods of institutional economics. The basic dia-lectical contradiction
   in this interpretation is the contradiction between the innovativeness
   of a set of ideas that form a new paradigm and ensure the systematic
   generation of intangible assets, and its liquidity. The liquidity of
   intangible assets is primarily determined by the extent to which society
   is ready to accept new ideas and views. The resolution of the
   identi-fied contradiction is carried out through a cyclical change in
   resistance to innovation. The period of dominance of a certain paradigm
   ends when it exhausts the potential of its deve-lopment, which
   determines the finiteness of the life cycle of any scientific paradigm,
   just as the life cycle of any inno-vation is finite.},

Abstract = {Accurate prediction of scientific impact is important for scientists,
   academic recommender systems, and granting organizations alike. Existing
   approaches rely on many years of leading citation values to predict a
   scientific paper's citations (a proxy for impact), even though most
   papers make their largest contributions in the first few years after
   they are published. In this paper, we tackle a new problem: predicting a
   new paper's citation time series from the date of publication (i.e.,
   without leading values). We propose HINTS, a novel end-to-end deep
   learning framework that converts citation signals from dynamic
   heterogeneous information networks (DHIN) into citation time series.
   HINTS imputes pseudo-leading values for a paper in the years before it
   is published from DHIN embeddings, and then transforms these embeddings
   into the parameters of a formal model that can predict citation counts
   immediately after publication. Empirical analysis on two real-world
   datasets from Computer Science and Physics show that HINTS is
   competitive with baseline citation prediction models. While we focus on
   citations, our approach generalizes to other ``cold start{''} time
   series prediction tasks where relational data is available and accurate
   prediction in early timestamps is crucial.},

Abstract = {Since Crepon, Duguet, and Mairesse published their ground-breaking
   article ('Research, Innovation and Productivity: An Econometric Analysis
   at the Firm Level', 1998), the CDM framework has known a large
   diffusion, despite being published in a non-indexed journal. The present
   study is an exploration of the spread and recombination of `knowledge'
   in the `CDM universe', comprising all papers in Scopus indexed journals
   citing CDM or/and CDM cited papers. We assess first the speed and range
   of diffusion of CDM and investigate next the `origins' and further
   `genealogical' make up of the knowledge recombinations within the CDM
   universe. We find that CDM is cited by a growing number of papers, which
   spread over a variety of fields, and that it compares very well with the
   most cited comparable articles in indexed journals in its domain of
   research. We further find that the CDM universe is mainly constituted of
   three large clusters and for each of them we are able to identify
   knowledge paths going from the CDM and earlier cited papers to the
   subsequent main citing papers. We intend to provide a detailed
   interpretation of these findings in future work.},

Abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has shown an upward trend of
   growth in the 21st century (from 2000 to 2015). The evolution in AI has
   advanced the development of human society in our own time, with dramatic
   revolutions shaped by both theories and techniques. However, the
   multidisciplinary and fastgrowing features make AI a field in which it
   is difficult to be well understood. In this paper, we study the
   evolution of AI at the beginning of the 21st century using publication
   metadata extracted from 9 top-tier journals and 12 top-tier conferences
   of this discipline. We find that the area is in the sustainable
   development and its impact continues to grow. From the perspective of
   reference behavior, the decrease in self-references indicates that the
   AI is becoming more and more open-minded. The influential
   papers/researchers/institutions we identified outline landmarks in the
   development of this field. Last but not least, we explore the inner
   structure in terms of topics' evolution over time. We have quantified
   the temporal trends at the topic level and discovered the inner
   connection among these topics. These findings provide deep insights into
   the current scientific innovations, as well as shedding light on funding
   policies.},

Abstract = {In recent years scholars have begun to apply perspectives of the
   sociology of scientific knowledge to technology. At the same time, there
   has been much concern about how to deal, methodologically, with the
   issue of reflexivity in sociological (and historical) studies of
   science. This paper considers implications of the reflexivity issue for
   sociological and historical accounts of technology. Drawing on
   characterizations of technology (mainly by its historians), the paper
   develops several senses in which technology is conceived to differ
   significantly from science. Accordingly, assumptions and approaches,
   contexts and expectations associated with the sociology of scientific
   knowledge may be inappropriate to the study of technology. These
   differences can be used to gain insights into the reflexivity question.
   If, as we have done in science, we look to the activity we study for
   guidance about how to study it, we may find technology to warrant a
   different conception of the location and purposes of its analysts than
   does science - a conception of the studier not as an isolated knower,
   but as a socially and politically involved co-creator. In line with
   recent suggestions of Sal Restivo and Bruno Latour, our activity as STS
   scholars might then better be characterized as a technology of
   technology (or science), rather than as a science of science (or
   technology).},

Abstract = {In the fast-growing scholarly big data background, social network
   technologies have recently aroused widespread attention in academia and
   industry. The concept of academic social networks is created precisely
   in the context of scholarly big data, which refers to the complicated
   academic network formed by academic entities and their relationships.
   There are a wealth of scholarly big data processing methods to analyze
   the rich structural types and related information about academic social
   networks. Nowadays, various academic data can be easily obtained, which
   makes it easier for us to analyze and study academic social networks.
   This study investigates the background, the current status, and trends
   of academic social networks. We first elaborate on the concept of
   academic social networks and related research background. Secondly, we
   analyze models based on nodes' types and timeliness. Thirdly, we review
   analytical methods, including relevant metrics, network properties, and
   available academic analysis tools. Furthermore, we sort out some key
   mining technologies for academic social networks. Finally, we
   systematically review representative research tasks in this domain from
   three levels: actor, relationship, and network. In addition, some
   academic social networking sites are presented. This survey concludes
   with the current challenges and open issues.},

Abstract = {Identifying important scholarly literature at an early stage is vital to
   the academic research community and other stakeholders such as
   technology companies and government bodies. Due to the sheer amount of
   research published and the growth of ever-changing interdisciplinary
   areas, researchers need an efficient way to identify important scholarly
   work. The number of citations a given research publication has accrued
   has been used for this purpose, but these take time to occur and longer
   to accumulate. In this article, we use alt metrics to predict the
   short-term and long-term citations that a scholarly publication could
   receive. We build various classification and regression models and
   evaluate their performance, finding neural networks and ensemble models
   to perform best for these tasks. We also find that Mendeley readership
   is the most important factor in predicting the early citations, followed
   by other factors such as the academic status of the readers (e.g.,
   student, postdoc, professor), followers on Twitter, online post length,
   author count, and the number of mentions on Twitter, Wikipedia, and
   across different countries.

Abstract = {Because the Impact Factor (IF) is an average quantity and most journals
   are small, IFs are volatile. We study how a single paper affects the IF
   using data from 11639 journals in the 2017 Journal Citation Reports. We
   define as volatility the IF gain (or loss) caused by a single paper, and
   this is inversely proportional to journal size. We find high
   volatilities for hundreds of journals annually due to their top-cited
   paper whetherit is a highly-cited paper in a small journal, or a
   moderately (or even low) cited paper in a small and low-cited journal.
   For example, 1218 journals had their most cited paper boost their IF by
   more than 20\%, while for 231 journals the boost exceeded 50\%. We find
   that small journals are rewarded much more than large journals for
   publishing a highly-cited paper, and are also penalized more for
   publishing a low-cited paper, especially if they have a high IF. This
   produces a strong incentive for prestigious, high-IF journals to stay
   small, to remain competitive in IF rankings. We discuss the implications
   for breakthrough papers to appear in prestigious journals. We also
   question the practice of ranking journals by IF given this uneven reward
   mechanism.},

Abstract = {We present a novel algorithm and validation method for disambiguating
   author names in very large bibliographic data sets and apply it to the
   full Web of Science (WoS) citation index. Our algorithm relies only upon
   the author and citation graphs available for the whole period covered by
   the WoS. A pair-wise publication similarity metric, which is based on
   common co-authors, self-citations, shared references and citations, is
   established to perform a two-step agglomerative clustering that first
   connects individual papers and then merges similar clusters. This
   parameterized model is optimized using an h-index based recall measure,
   favoring the correct assignment of well-cited publications, and a
   name-initials-based precision using WoS metadata and cross-referenced
   Google Scholar profiles. Despite the use of limited metadata, we reach a
   recall of 87\% and a precision of 88\% with a preference for researchers
   with high h-index values. 47 million articles of WoS can be
   disambiguated on a single machine in less than a day. We develop an
   h-index distribution model, confirming that the prediction is in
   excellent agreement with the empirical data, and yielding insight into
   the utility of the h-index in real academic ranking scenarios.},

Abstract = {Scientific breakthroughs are commonly understood as discoveries that
   transform the knowledge frontier and have a major impact on science,
   technology, and society. Prior literature studying breakthroughs
   generally treats them as a homogeneous group in attempts to identify
   supportive conditions for their occurrence. In this paper, we argue that
   there are different types of scientific breakthroughs, which differ in
   their disciplinary occurrence and are associated with different
   considerations of use and citation impact patterns. We develop a
   typology of scientific breakthroughs based on three binary dimensions of
   scientific discoveries and use this typology to analyze qualitatively
   the content of 335 scientific articles that report on breakthroughs. For
   each dimension, we test associations with scientific disciplines,
   reported use considerations, and scientific impact. We find that most
   scientific breakthroughs are driven by a question and in line with
   literature, and that paradigm shifting discoveries are rare. Regarding
   the scientific impact of breakthrough as measured by citations, we find
   that an article that answers an unanswered question receives more
   citations compared to articles that were not motivated by an unanswered
   question. We conclude that earlier research in which breakthroughs were
   operationalized as highly cited scientific articles may thus be biased
   against the latter.},

Abstract = {Scholarly impact assessment has always been a hot issue. It has played
   an important role in evaluating researchers, scientific papers,
   scientific teams, and institutions within science of science. Scholarly
   impact assessment is also used to address fundamental issues, such as
   reward evaluation, funding allocation, promotion and recruitment
   decision. Scholars generally agree that it is more reasonable to use
   weighted citations to assess the scholarly impact. Although a great
   number of researchers use weighted citations to access the scholarly
   impact, there is a lack of a systematic summary of citation weighting
   methods. To fill the gap, this paper summarizes the existing classical
   indicators and weighting methods used in measuring scholarly impact from
   the perspectives of articles, authors and journals. We also summarize
   the focus of the indicators involved in this paper and the weighting
   factors that involved in the weighting methods. Finally, we discuss the
   open issues to try to discover the hidden trends of citation weighting.
   Through this paper, we can not only have a clearer understanding of the
   weighting methods in the scholarly impact assessment, but also think
   more deeply about the weighting factors to be explored.},

Abstract = {The gradual crowding out of singleton and small team science by large
   team endeavors is challenging key features of research culture. It is
   therefore important for the future of scientific practice to reflect
   upon the individual scientist's ethical responsibilities within teams.
   To facilitate this reflection we show labor force trends in the US
   revealing a skewed growth in academic ranks and increased levels of
   competition for promotion within the system; we analyze teaming trends
   across disciplines and national borders demonstrating why it is becoming
   difficult to distribute credit and to avoid conflicts of interest; and
   we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to show how science is
   outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of particular
   concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the
   mentor-mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue
   ethics across scientific generations. These trends and emerging
   organizational complexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms
   that transcend team heterogeneity and hierarchy. To this end, our
   expository analysis provides a survey of ethical issues in team settings
   to inform science ethics education and science policy.},

Abstract = {Scientific prizes confer credibility to persons, ideas, and disciplines,
   provide financial incentives, and promote community-building
   celebrations. We examine the growth dynamics and interlocking
   relationships found in the worldwide scientific prize network. We focus
   on understanding how the knowledge linkages among prizes and scientists'
   propensities for prizewinning relate to knowledge pathways between
   disciplines and stratification within disciplines. Our data cover more
   than 3,000 different scientific prizes in diverse disciplines and the
   career histories of 10,455 prizewinners worldwide for over 100 years. We
   find several key links between prizes and scientific advances. First,
   despite an explosive proliferation of prizes over time and across the
   globe, prizes are more concentrated within a relatively small group of
   scientific elites, and ties among elites are highly clustered,
   suggesting that a relatively constrained number of ideas and scholars
   push the boundaries of science. For example, 64.1\% of prizewinners have
   won two prizes and 13.7\% have won five or more prizes. Second, certain
   prizes strongly interlock disciplines and subdisciplines, creating key
   pathways by which knowledge spreads and is recognized across science.
   Third, genealogical and coauthorship networks predict who wins multiple
   prizes, which helps to explain the interconnectedness among celebrated
   scientists and their pathbreaking ideas.},

Abstract = {The article continues the cycle of the author's works analyzing the
   objectivity of theology, its position within the scientific space and
   beyond. The analysis is given from the point of view of the philosophy
   of science as a philosophical discipline, which, in addition to the
   general section, has a specification of areas, branches and groups of
   specialties adopted in the modern science of science and scientometrics.
   The content of theology is described taking into account the work on
   improving the range of scientific specialties, which is now being
   carried out in Russia. First, the author proposes a method and
   parameters for evaluating the scientific work of a theologian, taking
   into account the worldview, competence and religious and confessional
   affiliation. This approach takes into account the peculiarities of the
   intellectual work of the theologian and describes the parameters that
   identify the results of this work. Secondly, the article deals with the
   religious-confessional and scientific aspects of theology as a branch of
   knowledge (a group of specialties), which is part of the family of
   social and human sciences. Thus, the author again draws attention to the
   intellectual and value-worldview resource of theology in modern life and
   the need to comprehend it, including within the framework of the
   philosophy of science.},

Title = {Completing Scientific Facts in Knowledge Graphs of Research Concepts},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {125867-125880},
Abstract = {In the last few years, we have witnessed the emergence of several
   knowledge graphs that explicitly describe research knowledge with the
   aim of enabling intelligent systems for supporting and accelerating the
   scientific process. These resources typically characterize a set of
   entities in this space (e.g., tasks, methods, evaluation techniques,
   proteins, chemicals), their relations, and the relevant actors (e.g.,
   researchers, organizations) and documents (e.g., articles, books).
   However, they are usually very partial representations of the actual
   research knowledge and may miss several relevant facts. In this paper,
   we introduce SciCheck, a new triple classification approach for
   completing scientific statements in knowledge graphs. SciCheck was
   evaluated against other state-of-the-art approaches on seven benchmarks,
   yielding excellent results. Finally, we provide a real-world use case
   and applied SciCheck to the Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Graph
   (AI-KG), a large-scale automatically-generated open knowledge graph
   including 1.2M statements extracted from the 333K most cited articles in
   the field of Artificial Intelligence, and generated a new version of
   this knowledge graph with 300K additional triples.},

Abstract = {With teams growing in all areas of scientific and scholarly research, we
   explore the relationship between team structure and the character of
   knowledge they produce. Drawing on 89,575 self-reports of team member
   research activity underlying scientific publications, we show how
   individual activities cohere into broad roles of 1) leadership through
   the direction and presentation of research and 2) support through data
   collection, analysis, and discussion. The hidden hierarchy of a
   scientific team is characterized by its lead (or L) ratio of members
   playing leadership roles to total team size. The L ratio is validated
   through correlation with imputed contributions to the specific paper and
   to science as a whole, which we use to effectively extrapolate the L
   ratio for 16,397,750 papers where roles are not explicit. We find that,
   relative to flat, egalitarian teams, tall, hierarchical teams produce
   less novelty and more often develop existing ideas, increase
   productivity for those on top and decrease it for those beneath, and
   increase shortterm citations but decrease long-term influence. These
   effects hold within person-the same person on the same-sized team
   produces science much more likely to disruptively innovate if they work
   on a flat, high-L-ratio team. These results suggest the critical role
   flat teams play for sustainable scientific advance and the training and
   advancement of scientists.},

Abstract = {Background: An article's citations are useful for finding related
   articles that may not be readily found by keyword searches or textual
   similarity. Citation analysis is also important for analyzing scientific
   innovation and the structure of the biomedical literature. We wanted to
   facilitate citation analysis for the broad community by providing a
   user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing citation data for
   biomedical articles.
   Case Presentation: We seeded the Citation Cloud dataset with over 465
   million open access citations culled from six different sources: PubMed
   Central, Microsoft Academic Graph, ArnetMiner, Semantic Scholar, Open
   Citations, and the NIH iCite dataset. We implemented a free, public
   extension to PubMed that allows any user to visualize and analyze the
   entire citation cloud around any paper of interest A: the set of
   articles cited by A, those which cite A, those which are cocited with A,
   and those which are bibliographically coupled to A.
   Conclusions: Citation Cloud greatly enables the study of citations by
   the scientific community, including relatively advanced analyses
   (co-citations and bibliographic coupling) that cannot be undertaken
   using other available tools. The tool can be accessed by running any
   PubMed query on the Anne O'Tate value-added search interface and
   clicking on the Citations button next to any retrieved article.},

Abstract = {Modern science is dominated by scientific productions from teams. A
   recent finding shows that teams of both large and small sizes are
   essential in research, prompting us to analyze the extent to which a
   country's scientific work is carried out by big or small teams. Here,
   using over 26 million publications from Web of Science, we find that
   China's research output is more dominated by big teams than the rest of
   the world, which is particularly the case in fields of natural science.
   Despite the global trend that more papers are written by big teams,
   China's drop in small team output is much steeper. As teams in China
   shift from small to large size, the team diversity that is essential for
   innovative work does not increase as much as that in other countries.
   Using the national average as the baseline, we find that the National
   Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) supports fewer small teams
   than the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States does,
   implying that big teams are preferred by grant agencies in China. Our
   finding provides new insights into the concern of originality and
   innovation in China, which indicates a need to balance small and big
   teams.},

Abstract = {Complex networks have attracted a great deal of research interest in the
   last two decades since Watts \& Strogatz, Barabasi \& Albert and Girvan
   \& Newman published their highly-cited seminal papers on small-world
   networks, on scale-free networks and on the community structure of
   complex networks, respectively. These fundamental papers initiated a new
   era of research establishing an interdisciplinary field called network
   science. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the field, a diverse but
   not divided network science community has emerged in the past 20 years.
   This paper honors the contributions of network science by exploring the
   evolution of this community as seen through the growing co-authorship
   network of network scientists (here the notion refers to a scholar with
   at least one paper citing at least one of the three aforementioned
   milestone papers). After investigating various characteristics of 29,528
   network science papers, we construct the co-authorship network of 52,406
   network scientists and we analyze its topology and dynamics. We shed
   light on the collaboration patterns of the last 20 years of network
   science by investigating numerous structural properties of the
   co-authorship network and by using enhanced data visualization
   techniques. We also identify the most central authors, the largest
   communities, investigate the spatiotemporal changes, and compare the
   properties of the network to scientometric indicators.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {05N06},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Evolutionary studies of cultural complexity often assume that group
   members select the best information available in the group, effectively
   diffusing the best innovations, whose advantages are subsequently passed
   on to the next generation. This would seem to describe the ideal of the
   scientific process - each cohort of papers in a field surfacing the best
   innovations, refining them and passing on to the next ``layer{''} or
   cohort of scientific works. Here, we use academic journal databases to
   explore this ``forking{''} (branching) process in the evolution of a
   scientific paradigm. We apply citation network visualization and Latent
   Dirichlet allocation topic analysis to three different paradigms defined
   pragmatically as the set of papers citing a highly influential paper in
   each respective case. Our three case studies indicate a founder effect
   in how the seminal paper is highly-embedded in the citation network, and
   yet peripheral to the evolution of topics in subsequent ``layers{''} of
   publications within the paradigm. This and additional evidence suggest
   certain topics are selected and followed, while others are left behind.
   From these case studies we discuss how hitherto undeveloped ideas of the
   past might be located in the topic space of seminal works of the same
   fruitful time period.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, we conduct a multi-angular analysis of the
   interdisciplinarity of Nobel Prize winning research compared to
   non-Nobel Prize winning articles, based on a large data set. Here
   interdisciplinarity is measured by the diversity of references, using
   two true diversity indicators. Articles mentioned by the Nobel Prize
   committee in Physiology or Medicine (in short: NP articles) awarded
   during the period from 1900 to 2016 are the focus of our research. These
   articles are compared with those in a dataset of articles that do not
   include a Nobel Prize winner among their authors. Moreover, these
   non-NPs articles were not only published in the same year and in the
   same research field as the NP ones but were also dealing with the same
   research topic (such articles are referred to as non-NP articles). The
   results suggest that the topic-related knowledge included in Nobel Prize
   winning work is higher than that in non-NPs, hence with lower
   interdisciplinarity than the latter. Our findings provide useful clues
   to better understand the characteristics of transformative research,
   here represented by key publications by Nobel Prize laureates in
   Physiology or Medicine, and their pattern of knowledge integration.},

Abstract = {This paper articulates a citation-based approach to science policy
   evaluation and employs that approach to investigate the impact of the
   United States 2001 policy regarding the federal funding of human
   embryonic stem cell (hESC) research. We evaluate the impact of the
   policy on the level of U.S. hESC research, the U.S. position at the
   knowledge frontier, and the strategic response of U.S. scientists.
   Consistent with recent research on the science of science and innovation
   policy, we employ a difference-in-differences approach using
   bibliometric data with the aim of analyzing the causal impact of the
   policy on cumulative research. Our estimates suggest that in the
   aftermath of the 2001 policy, U.S. production of hESC research lagged 35
   to 40 percent behind anticipated levels. However, this relative decline
   was largely concentrated in the years 2001 to 2003 and ameliorated over
   time. The rebound in U.S. hESC research after 2003 was driven by
   contributions by researchers at elite U.S. institutions and U.S.
   researchers who collaborated with international partners. The results
   suggest that scientists respond strategically to research funding
   restrictions and that modest science policy shifts can have a
   significant influence on the within-country composition of research and
   the pattern of global research collaboration. (C) 2012 by the

Abstract = {Funding inputs and research outputs have always been two central issues
   in the science of science. In recent decades, research funding plays an
   increasingly important role in scientific research. Thus, it is
   progressively significant for management authorities to measure the
   research efficiency of highly funded scientists, which can be helpful
   for them to make effective policies. However, few researchers use
   quantitative analysis to study these issues. To promote the research in
   this field, we begin with collecting a dataset. This dataset contains
   research funding and other information from 345 highly funded scientists
   in Mainland China. Next, we use the dataset to measure the efficiency of
   highly funded scientists based on the data envelopment analysis. In this
   way, highly funded scientists are placed into several levels according
   to their research inputs and outputs. We also give their attractiveness
   and progress scores compared to other grades. The learning path for less
   efficient scientists is also provided. We find that highly funded
   scientists have relatively high efficiency in three kinds of projects,
   such as the Major Research Plan. Besides, the career length and career
   start year are demonstrated to have a limited impact on the highly
   funded scientists. These patterns are beneficial for the development of
   the scientific community and management authorities to make policies.},

Abstract = {The history of AI in economics is long and winding, much the same as the
   evolving field of AI itself. Economists have engaged with AI since its
   beginnings, albeit in varying degrees and with changing focus across
   time and places. In this study, we have explored the diffusion of AI and
   different AI methods (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, neural
   networks, expert systems, knowledge-based systems) through and within
   economic subfields, taking a scientometrics approach. In particular, we
   centre our accompanying discussion of AI in economics around the
   problems of economic calculation and social planning as proposed by
   Hayek. To map the history of AI within and between economic sub-fields,
   we construct two datasets containing bibliometrics information of
   economics papers based on search query results from the Scopus database
   and the EconPapers (and IDEAs/RePEc) repository. We present descriptive
   results that map the use and discussion of AI in economics over time,
   place, and subfield. In doing so, we also characterise the authors and
   affiliations of those engaging with AI in economics. Additionally, we
   find positive correlations between quality of institutional affiliation
   and engagement with or focus on AI in economics and negative
   correlations between the Human Development Index and share of
   learning-based AI papers.},

Abstract = {There is extensive, yet fragmented, evidence of gender differences in
   academia suggesting that women are underrepresented in most scientific
   disciplines and publish fewer articles throughout a career, and their
   work acquires fewer citations. Here, we offer a comprehensive picture of
   longitudinal gender differences in performance through a bibliometric
   analysis of academic publishing careers by reconstructing the complete
   publication history of over 1.5 million gender-identified authors whose
   publishing career ended between 1955 and 2010, covering 83 countries and
   13 disciplines. We find that, paradoxically, the increase of
   participation of women in science over the past 60 years was accompanied
   by an increase of gender differences in both productivity and impact.
   Most surprisingly, though, weuncover two gender invariants, finding that
   men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and have equivalent
   career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we
   demonstrate that differences in publishing career lengths and dropout
   rates explain a large portion of the reported career-wise differences in
   productivity and impact, although productivity differences still remain.
   This comprehensive picture of gender inequality in academia can help
   rephrase the conversation around the sustainability of women's careers
   in academia, with important consequences for institutions and policy
   makers.},

Abstract = {Science studies suffers from a sense of secondariness. It can abandon
   this inferiority if it relocates itself in terms of a politics of
   knowledge. Science studies should stop viewing itself as a quilt patch
   of subjects and reading itself as a creative mediation between knowledge
   and power. This is illustrated in terms of the emergence of Science
   Studies in India. Official India emphasized science policy as an
   extension of the Nation-State. Science studies arose as a response to
   science policy questioning the social contract between Science and State
   in India. Science studies emerged as a part of civil society after the
   Emergency of 1975 and among social movements rather than as a
   professionalized academic subject. In attempting to create an identity,
   science studies moved across four axis of possibility: the science of
   science, interdisciplinary science, transscience, and alternative
   science. The second part of the paper links science studies to the
   democratic imagination. It argues that the citizen must be seen as a
   scientist, a person of knowledge not merely as a consumer and voter. The
   citizen thus becomes a trustee of local, defeated and marginal forms of
   knowledge. Its real role is in enhancing the democratic imagination,
   providing methodologies of conflict resolution and plural frameworks of
   knowledge for cognitive justice, thus emerging as a site for dissenting
   imaginations against the emerging global regime. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {What conditions enable novel intellectual contributions to diffuse and
   become integrated into later scientific work? Prior work tends to focus
   on whole cultural products, such as patents and articles, and emphasizes
   external social factors as important. This article focuses on concepts
   as reflections of ideas, and we identify the combined influence that
   social factors and internal intellectual structures have on ideational
   diffusion. To develop this perspective, we use computational techniques
   to identify nearly 60,000 new ideas introduced over two decades (1993 to
   2016) in the Web of Science and follow their diffusion across 38 million
   later publications. We find new ideas diffuse more widely when they
   socially and intellectually resonate. New ideas become core concepts of
   science when they reach expansive networks of unrelated authors, achieve
   consistent intellectual usage, are associated with other prominent
   ideas, and fit with extant research traditions. These ecological
   conditions play an increasingly decisive role later in an idea's career,
   after their relations with the environment are established. This work
   advances the systematic study of scientific ideas by moving beyond
   products to focus on the content of ideas themselves and applies a
   relational perspective that takes seriously the contingency of their
   success.},

Title = {The AIDA Dashboard: A Web Application for Assessing and Comparing
   Scientific Conferences},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {39471-39486},
Abstract = {Scientific conferences are essential for developing active research
   communities, promoting the cross-pollination of ideas and technologies,
   bridging between academia and industry, and disseminating new findings.
   Analyzing and monitoring scientific conferences is thus crucial for all
   users who need to take informed decisions in this space. However,
   scholarly search engines and bibliometric applications only provide a
   limited set of analytics for assessing research conferences, preventing
   us from performing a comprehensive analysis of these events. In this
   paper, we introduce the AIDA Dashboard, a novel web application,
   developed in collaboration with Springer Nature, for analyzing and
   comparing scientific conferences. This tool introduces three major new
   features: 1) it enables users to easily compare conferences within
   specific fields (e.g., Digital Libraries) and time-frames (e.g., the
   last five years); 2) it characterises conferences according to a 14K
   research topics from the Computer Science Ontology (CSO); and 3) it
   provides several functionalities for assessing the involvement of
   commercial organizations, including the ability to characterize
   industrial contributions according to 66 industrial sectors (e.g.,
   automotive, financial, energy, electronics) from the Industrial Sectors
   Ontology (INDUSO). We evaluated the AIDA Dashboard by performing both a
   quantitative evaluation and a user study, obtaining excellent results in
   terms of quality of the analytics and usability.},

Abstract = {Data Mining and Information Retrieval is an emerging interdisciplinary
   discipline dealing with Information Retrieval and Data Mining
   techniques. It has undergone rapid development with the advances in
   mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. In
   this paper, we present an empirical analysis of publication metadata
   obtained from 6 top-tier journals and 9 conferences for the first 16
   years of the 21st Century, and evaluate the dynamic characteristics of
   Data Mining and Information Retrieval. We find a steady growth both in
   terms of productivity and impact, evidenced by the unabated number of
   publications/citations over the period of study. We note that the
   modality for co-operation in this field is changing from independent to
   collaborative. Furthermore, according to the citation pattern, the field
   is becoming open-minded as illustrated by a gradual decline of
   self-citation rates, which was dropped to 10\% in 2015, nearly three
   times lower than what it was in 2000. Finally, we explore the inner
   structure relying on the topics evolution from the aspects of popular
   keywords/topics identification and evolution. Overall, this study
   provides insights of Data Mining and Information Retrieval behind its
   demonstrated growth in the recent past, with the ultimate goal of
   revealing its potential of driving scientific innovation in the future.

Abstract = {This paper proposes an Ontology-Based Data Management (OBDM) approach to
   coordinate, integrate and maintain the data needed for Science,
   Technology and Innovation (STI) policy development. The OBDM approach is
   a form of integration of information in which the global schema of data
   is substituted by the conceptual model of the domain, formally specified
   through an ontology. Implemented in Sapientia, the ontology of
   multi-dimensional research assessment, it offers a transparent platform
   as the base for the assessment process; it enables one to define and
   specify in an unambiguous way the indicators on which the evaluation is
   based, and to track their evolution over time; also it allows to the
   analysis of the effects of the actual use of the indicators on the
   behavior of scholars, and spot opportunistic behaviors; and it provides
   a monitoring system to track over time the changes in the established
   evaluation criteria and their consequences for the research system. It
   is argued that easier access to and a more transparent view of
   scientific-scholarly outcomes help to improve the understanding of basic
   science and the communication of research outcomes to the wider public.
   An OBDM approach could successfully contribute to solve some of the key
   issues in the integration of heterogeneous data for STI policies.},

Abstract = {Video communication has been rapidly increasing over the past decade,
   with YouTube providing a medium where users can post, discover, share,
   and react to videos. There has also been an increase in the number of
   videos citing research articles, especially since it has become
   relatively commonplace for academic conferences to require video
   submissions. However, the relationship between research articles and
   YouTube videos is not clear, and the purpose of the present paper is to
   address this issue. We created new datasets using YouTube videos and
   mentions of research articles on various online platforms. We found that
   most of the articles cited in the videos are related to medicine and
   biochemistry. We analyzed these datasets through statistical techniques
   and visualization, and built machine learning models to predict (1)
   whether a research article is cited in videos, (2) whether a research
   article cited in a video achieves a level of popularity, and (3) whether
   a video citing a research article becomes popular. The best models
   achieved F1 scores between 80\% and 94\%. According to our results,
   research articles mentioned in more tweets and news coverage have a
   higher chance of receiving video citations. We also found that video
   views are important for predicting citations and increasing research
   articles' popularity and public engagement with science.},

Abstract = {Newton's centuries-old wisdom of standing on the shoulders of giants
   raises a crucial yet underexplored question: Out of all the prior works
   cited by a discovery, which one is its giant? Here, we develop a
   discipline-independent method to identify the giant for any individual
   paper, allowing us to better understand the role and characteristics of
   giants in science. We find that across disciplines, about 95\% of papers
   appear to stand on the shoulders of giants, yet the weight of scientific
   progress rests on relatively few shoulders. Defining a new measure of
   giant index, we find that, while papers with high citations are more
   likely to be giants, for papers with the same citations, their giant
   index sharply predicts a paper's future impact and prize-winning
   probabilities. Giants tend to originate from both small and large teams,
   being either highly disruptive or highly developmental. Papers that did
   not have a giant tend to do poorly on average, yet interestingly, if
   such papers later became a giant for other papers, they tend to be
   home-run papers that are highly disruptive to science. Given the crucial
   importance of citation-based measures in science, the developed concept
   of giants may offer a useful dimension in assessing scientific impact
   that goes beyond sheer citation counts.},

Abstract = {Scientific discovery has long been one of the central driving forces in
   our civilization. It uncovered the principles of the world we live in,
   and enabled us to invent new technologies reshaping our society, cure
   diseases, explore unknown new frontiers, and hopefully lead us to build
   a sustainable society. Accelerating the speed of scientific discovery is
   therefore one of the most important endeavors. This requires an in-depth
   understanding of not only the subject areas but also the nature of
   scientific discoveries themselves. In other words, the ``science of
   science{''} needs to be established, and has to be implemented using
   artificial intelligence (AI) systems to be practically executable. At
   the same time, what may be implemented by ``AI Scientists{''} may not
   resemble the scientific process conducted by human scientist. It may be
   an alternative form of science that will break the limitation of current
   scientific practice largely hampered by human cognitive limitation and
   sociological constraints. It could give rise to a human-AI hybrid form
   of science that shall bring systems biology and other sciences into the
   next stage. The Nobel Turing Challenge aims to develop a highly
   autonomous AI system that can perform top-level science,
   indistinguishable from the quality of that performed by the best human
   scientists, where some of the discoveries may be worthy of Nobel Prize
   level recognition and beyond.},

Abstract = {National governments spend significant amounts of money supporting
   public research. However, in an era where the international economic
   climate has led to budget cuts, policymakers increasingly are looking to
   justify the returns from public investments, including in science and
   innovation. The so-called `impact agenda' which has emerged in many
   countries around the world is part of this response; an attempt to
   understand and articulate for the public what benefits arise from the
   research that is funded. The United Kingdom is the most progressed in
   implementing this agenda and in 2014 the national research assessment
   exercise, the Research Excellence Framework, for the first time included
   the assessment of research impact as a component. For the first time
   within a dual funding system, funding would be awarded not only on the
   basis of the academic quality of research, but also on the wider impacts
   of that research. In this paper we outline the context and approach
   taken by the UK government, along with some of the core challenges that
   exist in implementing such an exercise. We then synthesise, together for
   the first time, the results of the only two national evaluations of the
   exercise and offer reflections for future exercises both in the UK and
   internationally.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper throws light on some of the nature of artificial
   intelligence (AI) development, which will serve as a starter for helping
   to advance its development. Design/methodology/approach This work
   reveals the evolutions and trends of AI from four dimensions: research,
   output, influence and competition through leveraging academic knowledge
   graph with 130,750 AI scholars and 43,746 scholarly articles. Findings
   The authors unearth that the ``research convergence{''} phenomenon
   becomes more evident in current AI research for scholars' highly similar
   research interests in different regions. The authors notice that
   Pareto's principle applies to AI scholars' outputs, and the outputs have
   been increasing at an explosive rate in the past two decades. The
   authors discover that top works dominate the AI academia, for they
   attracted considerable attention. Finally, the authors delve into AI
   competition, which accelerates technology development, talent flow, and
   collaboration. Originality/value The work aims to throw light on the
   nature of AI development, which will serve as a starter for helping to
   advance its development. The work will help us to have a more
   comprehensive and profound understanding of the evolutions and trends,
   which bridge the gap between literature research and AI development as
   well as enlighten the way the authors promote AI development and its
   strategy formulation.},

Abstract = {Collaboration is an integral element of the scientific process that
   often leads to findings with significant impact. While extensive efforts
   have been devoted to quantifying and predicting research impact, the
   question of how collaborative behavior influences scientific impact
   remains unaddressed. In this work, we study the interplay between
   scientists' collaboration signatures and their scientific impact. As the
   basis of our study, we employ an ArnetMiner dataset with more than 1.7
   million authors and 2 million papers spanning over 60 years. We formally
   define a scientist's collaboration signature as the distribution of
   collaboration strengths with each collaborator in his or her academic
   ego network, which is quantified by four measures: sociability,
   dependence, diversity, and self-collaboration. We then demonstrate that
   the collaboration signature allows us to effectively distinguish between
   researchers with dissimilar levels of scientific impact. We also
   discover that, even from the early stages of one's researcher career, a
   scientist's collaboration signature can help to reveal his or her future
   scientific impact. Finally, we find that as a representative group of
   outstanding computer scientists, Turing Award winners collectively
   produce distinctive collaboration signatures throughout the entirety of
   their careers. Our conclusions on the relationship between collaboration
   signatures and scientific impact give rise to important implications for
   researchers who wish to expand their scientific impact and more
   effectively stand on the shoulders of ``collaborators.{''}},

Abstract = {Information systems (IS) is a vital research area in both science and
   engineering, whose revolutions in terms of theories, techniques, and
   applications promote the evolution of human society. At the same time,
   the complexity and dynamics of IS raise the challenge for exploring the
   topic in detail. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis on
   bibliographic dataset to reveal the evolution of information systems in
   2 decades (1996-2015). We select 39,767 papers published in 8 top-tier
   journals and conferences between 1996 and 2015 and explore the anatomy
   from manifold. We find that IS is experiencing the sustainable growth
   phase in terms of increased productivity, impact, and collaboration. The
   field is benefited from collaborative, open-minded, and in-depth efforts
   evidenced from the growing number of co-authors per paper, the continual
   declining of self-citation rate, and increased reference age,
   respectively. By applying topic detection models on paper titles,
   abstracts, and keywords, we infer the representative topics and research
   directions, which can also reveal the research landscape within this
   field. Finally, we measure the temporal trends of topics and identify
   the innovative years in the20 years' development history of IS. These
   discoveries can benefit not only researchers in terms of promoting
   understanding of the entire field, but also governments for funding
   agencies.},

Abstract = {Although the ``science of science communication{''} usually refers to
   the flow of scientific knowledge from scientists to the public,
   scientists direct most of their communications not to the public, but
   instead to other scientists in their field. This paper presents a case
   study on this understudied type of communication: within a discipline,
   among its practitioners. I argue that many of the contentious
   disagreements that exist today in the field in which I conduct my
   research-early science education-derive from a lack of operational
   definitions, such that when competing claims are made for the efficacy
   of one type of science instruction vs. another, the arguments are
   hopelessly disjointed. The aim of the paper is not to resolve the
   current claims and counterclaims about the most effective pedagogies in
   science education, but rather to note that the assessment of one
   approach vs. the other is all too often defended on the basis of
   strongly held beliefs, rather than on the results of replicable
   experiments, designed around operational definitions of the teaching
   methods being investigated. A detailed example of operational
   definitions from my own research on elementary school science
   instruction is provided. In addition, the paper addresses the issue of
   how casual use of labels-both within the discipline and when
   communicating with the public-may inadvertently ``undo{''} the benefits
   of operational definitions.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Every year the National Institutes of Health allocates \$10.7 billion
   (one-third of its funds) for clinical science research while the
   pharmaceutical companies spend \$52.9 billion (90\% of its annual
   budget). However, we know little about funder collaborations and the
   impact of collaboratively funded projects. As an initial effort towards
   this, we examine the co-funding network, where a funder represents a
   node and an edge signifies collaboration. Our core data include all
   papers that cite and receive citations by the Cochrane Database of
   Systemic Reviews, a prominent clinical review journal. We find that 65\%
   of clinical papers have multiple funders and discover communities of
   funders that are formed by national boundaries and funding objectives.
   To quantify success in funding, we use a g-index metric that indicates
   efficiency of funders in supporting clinically relevant research. After
   controlling for authorship, we find that funders generally achieve
   higher success when collaborating than when solo-funding. We also find
   that as a funder, seeking multiple, direct connections with various
   disconnected funders may be more beneficial than being part of a densely
   interconnected network of co-funders. The results of this paper indicate
   that collaborations can potentially accelerate innovation, not only
   among authors but also funders.},

Abstract = {In China, it has long become imperative for the management of education,
   science and technology to build up high-level teams of scientific and
   technological innovation. Scientifically and accurately identifying core
   scientific research teams is an important prerequisite for cultivating
   and building such teams. The absolute threshold method (e.g., c-level
   clique at, n-clique, k-core) is the prevailing means of identifying core
   teams and their core members. Multiple factors such as ``the
   preference-dependent effect{''}, ``the apostle effect{''} and ``the star
   effect{''}, and the cooperative relationship between the researchers
   could be considered. This study, based on the co-authorship network,
   found that not choosing the absolute threshold properly could easily
   lead to poor identification of core members of some teams. Even worse,
   when the absolute threshold is too large, this ``uniform{''} evaluation
   criterion of tie strength results in the elimination of some core teams
   in some disciplines. This paper uses the relative tie strength to
   identify core scientific research teams from a new perspective, which
   can effectively avoid the situation of some core team members being
   ignored because of the mandatory requirements of the absolute tie
   strength among members, and can also solve the challenge of threshold
   selections for identifying different teams.},

Title = {The landscape and evolution of urban planning science},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {136},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The science of urban planning has drawn on a wide range of disciplines
   and research perspectives. This makes it challenging to define the
   boundaries and directions of the field. Here, nearly 100,000 articles on
   urban planning are analysed to objectively determine divisions, temporal
   trends and influential references and actors of urban planning. In terms
   of the structural composition, four broad divisions are identified: (1)
   governance and policy, (2) economics and markets, (3) housing and (4)
   built and natural environment. In terms of the temporal evo-lution, the
   earliest trends were related to ``welfare economics{''}, ``agglomeration
   economies{''}, ``urban economics{''}, and ``urban growth machine{''}.
   During the 1980s and 1990s, the focus moved towards ``regional policy
   and development{''}, ``social welfare{''}, and ``urban renaissance{''}.
   This trend continued during the 2000s and 2010s, heading to ``urban
   morphology{''}, ``participatory planning{''}, ``urban sociology{''},
   ``global cities{''}, and ``political economy{''}. The field has recently
   headed towards areas of ``resilience{''}, ``smart cities{''} and ``urban
   green space{''}. These transitions have been derivative, and the
   paradigm shifts have been very gradual. Another key observation is a
   notable increase in author connectivity and international collaboration.
   The results provide objective insights into how the science of urban
   planning has historically transitioned and where it is headed.},

Title = {Gender Gap in Scientific Publications on COVID-19 in Italy During the
   First Wave of the Pandemic: An Observational Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {BackgroundWorldwide, concerns rise on how COVID-19 pandemic impacted
   heavily on women, even on those belonging to the scientific community.
   The Italian scientific production regarding the COVID-19 throughout the
   first months of the health emergency could help to understand the heft
   of female researchers in this unique period. ObjectivesThis study aims
   to investigate the gender gap in the scientific production on COVID-19
   in Italy during the first months of the pandemic. MethodsA systematic
   search of the literature was conducted and, for each included study,
   first and last author's gender, type of study, number of co-authors,
   type of affiliation, journal's Impact Factor (IF) and specialization
   were extracted. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed.
   Results22.2\% of the articles were signed by a woman as first author,
   18.1\% as last authors. Female authorship was less frequent than male
   authorship regardless of the type of study, number of co-authors, type
   of affiliation and field of specialization. ConclusionThis analysis
   reveal a low prevalence of studies with a female first or last author
   and suggests that the low share of female authors publishing on COVID-19
   during the considered timespan is a transversal issue throughout the
   Italian medical field.},

Abstract = {Although scientometricians have focused on the strength of the citation
   impact of scientific publications, only a few have paid special
   attention to the width of the citation impact. In this article, we aim
   to understand the width by establishing our empirical study on a
   previously built structure, namely ego-centered citation networks
   (ECCNs). We remove the direct links to the focal publication and only
   retain the other edges in the network. Particularly, we examine the
   number and the size of the connected components of sub-networks of ECCNs
   in the whole Web of Science database. We find that the number and size
   of the connected components increase as the number of citations of
   publications rises, regardless of discipline, and that they are greater
   in recent publications than in older ones. We also observe that there
   are some differences in terms of the number/size of the connected
   components; particularly, the number/size of connected components for
   publications in Arts and Humanities is more ``special{''} compared with
   other disciplines, and Natural Sciences tends to have greater values.
   These details are indicative in terms of the specializations of
   academia. Moreover, the findings have far-reaching implications on
   research assessment practices and literature searching.},

Abstract = {Assessing scholarly influence is critical for understanding the
   collective system of scholarship and the history of academic inquiry.
   Influence is multifaceted, and citations reveal only part of it.
   Citation counts exhibit preferential attachment and follow a rigid
   ``news cycle{''} that can miss sustained and indirect forms of
   influence. Building on dynamic topic models that track distributional
   shifts in discourse over time, we introduce a variant that incorporates
   features, such as authorship, affiliation, and publication venue, to
   assess how these contexts interact with content to shape future
   scholarship. We perform in-depth analyses on collections of physics
   research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally (JSTOR
   repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of
   document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such
   as winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked
   institution, boost influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive
   influence reveals that citations tend to credit authors who persist in
   their fields over time and discount credit for works that are
   influential over many topics or are ``ahead of their time.{''} In this
   way, our measures provide a way to acknowledge diverse contributions
   that take longer and travel farther to achieve scholarly appreciation,
   enabling us to correct citation biases and enhance sensitivity to the
   full spectrum of scholarly impact.},

Title = {Discovering Interdisciplinarily Spread Knowledge in the Academic
   Literature},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {124142-124151},
Abstract = {With the increase in scientific publications and the diversification of
   research areas, science has become complex and interdisciplinary.
   Discovering important knowledge has become difficult even for
   researchers in specific domains. Previously proposed keyphrase
   extraction methods focus mainly on detecting intensively discussed
   topics in specific domains but do not distinguish concepts with the
   interdisciplinary spread from those discussed in narrow areas. Here, we
   propose a diffusion meme score that evaluates the knowledge diffusion
   distance in a paper citation network. The distance between papers that
   contain specific terms is measured by the network embedding space of the
   citation network. Using 57 million publication records from 48 years of
   Scopus, we evaluated newly appearing terms in and after 1975 in
   biomedical science papers using the proposed indicator. Approximately
   half of the top 20 terms were related to Nobel Prize or Clarivate
   Citation Laureates, and the top terms of the indicators were more likely
   to appear in Wikipedia than terms extracted using existing methods.
   Moreover, the top terms were unlikely to include specific minor
   diseases, which are often extracted using existing methods. Therefore,
   the diffusion meme score evaluates important terms from scientific
   literature and citation networks that are more interdisciplinary. Our
   method improves the understanding of young researchers regarding
   domains, the development of the history of science, and the evaluation
   of researcher contributions.},

Title = {Characterizing scientists leaving science before their time: Evidence

Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Scientists' leaving scientific work at an age when they should have
   continued generating more scientific output inevitably leads to limited
   success in their careers as scientists. However, this phenomenon has
   received relatively little attention in science of science and
   scientometrics, relative to how frequently it occurs in academia.
   Motivated by this gap, this study seeks to identify and characterize
   scientists who leave the profession before the expected time in science,
   i.e., scientists whose productivity digresses from the normal pattern at
   a stage when they should be capable of publishing more papers. We first
   argue that simply using the termination of publishing as the sign of
   leaving the profession is inappropriate. Using termination of publishing
   as the only standard also leads to an underestimation of the overall
   productivity of certain types of scientists. Thus, we designed a novel
   measure to evaluate whether a scientist has left science. Utilizing a
   large-scale bibliographic dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) in
   the field of mathematics, we identified over 10,000 scientists who left
   before their 20th career year, and paired each of them with a scientist
   who survived for longer than 25 years. We found that the characteristics
   in the first five years of the careers of the scientists who left early
   can be summarized as incompetency in their research abilities and a lack
   of collaboration with senior or highly cited authors. The implications
   of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {A lot of research on international convention-controlled halogenated
   gases (CHGs) has been carried out. However, few bibliometric analyses
   and literature reviews exist in this field. Based on 734 articles
   extracted from the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded database of the
   Web of Science, we provided the visualisation for the performance of
   contributors and trends in research content by using VOSviewer and
   Science of Science (Sci2). The results showed that the United States was
   the most productive country, followed by the United Kingdom and China.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had the largest
   number of publications, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology (MIT) and the University of Bristol. In terms of disciplines,
   environmental science and meteorological and atmospheric science have
   contributed the most. By using cluster analysis of all keywords, four
   key research topics of CHGs were identified and reviewed: (1) emissions
   calculation, (2) physicochemical analysis of halocarbons, (3) evaluation
   of replacements, and (4) environmental impact. The change in research
   substances is closely related to the phase-out schedule of the Montreal
   Protocol. In terms of environmental impact, global warming has always
   been the most important research hotspot, whereas research on
   ozone-depleting substances and biological toxicity shows a gradually
   rising trend.},

Abstract = {Quantitative analyses on delayed recognition indicated by slow-cited
   papers, including delayed papers and durable papers, have long been
   discussed to reveal why outstanding discoveries re-main unnoticed.
   However, these analyses include contradictory arguments, such as which
   combi-nations of knowledge, over-specialization, or transdisciplinary
   factors have led to undervaluation. We claim that this is because the
   indicators of delayed recognition are methodologically similar but
   capture conceptually different phenomena. Subsequently, this paper
   examined the overlap of 11 slow-cited measures to identify the
   uniformity and inconsistency of delayed recognition. Consequently, each
   measure practically obtained different papers as delayed recognition
   objec-tively classified into four groups by citation feature clustering,
   albeit based on similar concepts. Despite the ambiguity, we found that
   all delayed recognition measures extract papers that are more likely to
   be single-author projects that make disruptive contributions to more
   diverse fields without extremely novel nor conventional knowledge
   combinations that have been gradually awakened, compared to the null
   models. This result is robust when applying other hyperparam-eters,
   research topic-controlled null models, year-controlled null models, and
   other fields. This strongly indicates that delayed recognition leads to
   the reconstruction of a new direction of sci-ence and contributes to
   pioneering a revolutionary research topic. The source code for
   extracting slow-cited papers is available online.1},

Title = {The science of science is fun: assessing the impact of interactive
   science demonstrations through everyday experiences and near-peer role
   modeling},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Month = {2023 JAN 18},
Abstract = {Science demonstrations are a simple, cost-effective method of improving
   interest in STEM and highlighting the diversity of scientists, which can
   impact audience members' sense of belonging and, in turn, influence
   self-efficacy. However, the pedagogy of science demonstrations has been
   criticized as creating a power imbalance between the presenter and
   audience, for being too far removed from the audience's prior
   experiences, and for lacking interactivity. We report here on an
   intervention that designed demonstration-experiments to address a lack
   of interactivity while supporting interest; contextualized
   demonstrations within everyday experiences to address a lack of prior
   experiences and support interest, and implemented a near-peer role
   modeling strategy through high school near-peer role models to address
   power imbalances while supporting self-efficacy and expanding
   fourth-grade students' perceptions of who can be a scientist. The study
   explores the effects of the intervention using a pre-post survey design
   analyzed by repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (rmMANOVA)
   (n = 444). Significant improvement was observed for all motivational
   variables. These results suggest that interactive science demonstrations
   focused on students' everyday experiences may be an effective strategy
   to foster STEM interest and self-efficacy and to improve perceptions of
   who can be a scientist when enacted through high school near-peer role
   models.},

Abstract = {Women and men often contribute differently to research knowledge. Do
   differences in these contributions partially explain disparities in
   academic career outcomes? We explore this by looking at how gender is
   embodied in research language, and then ascertain whether the adoption
   of more gendered research language affects career outcomes beyond the
   researcher's attributes. We identify different forms of gendered
   knowledge-gender referents (explicit references to sex and gender) and
   gender-associated terms (words that are implicitly associated with women
   or men researchers)-by applying natural language processing techniques
   to nearly one million doctoral dissertations published in the United
   States between 1980 and 2010. We then determine whether employing gender
   referents and gender-associated terms affects the course of PhDs'
   ensuing careers. We find women researchers have lower chances of
   securing academic positions than men in every field; explicit references
   to women as research subjects are modestly rewarded in comparison to
   references to men; and more career opportunities are afforded to
   research knowledge associated with men. These results suggest that
   academia is slowly correcting the traditional and explicit bias of
   studying men at the exclusion of women. Still, there remains a stronger
   implicit bias against knowledge associated with women scholars. We
   discuss relative differences between humanities and social sciences
   versus natural sciences, technology, engineering, and math, as well as
   potential treatments for offsetting bias in those fields.},

Abstract = {One of the disciplines behind the science of science is the study of
   scientific networks. This work focuses on scientific networks as a
   social network having different nodes and connections. Nodes can be
   represented by authors, articles or journals while connections by
   citation, co-citation or co-authorship. One of the challenges in
   creating scientific networks is the lack of publicly available
   comprehensive data set. It limits the variety of analyses on the same
   set of nodes of different scientific networks. To supplement such
   analyses we have worked on publicly available citation metadata from
   Crossref and OpenCitatons. Using this data a workflow is developed to
   create scientific networks. Analysis of these networks gives insights
   into academic research and scholarship. Different techniques of social
   network analysis have been applied in the literature to study these
   networks. It includes centrality analysis, community detection, and
   clustering coefficient. We have used metadata of Scientometrics journal,
   as a case study, to present our workflow. We did a sample run of the
   proposed workflow to identify prominent authors using centrality
   analysis. This work is not a bibliometric study of any field rather it
   presents replicable Python scripts to perform network analysis. With an
   increase in the popularity of open access and open metadata, we
   hypothesise that this workflow shall provide an avenue for understanding
   scientific scholarship in multiple dimensions.},

Abstract = {Reputation is an important social construct in science, which enables
   informed quality assessments of both publications and careers of
   scientists in the absence of complete systemic information. However, the
   relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains
   poorly understood, despite recent proliferation of quantitative research
   evaluation methods. Here, we develop an original framework for measuring
   how a publication's citation rate Delta c depends on the reputation of
   its central author i, in addition to its net citation count c. To
   estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a
   longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly cited scientists,
   using the total citations C-i of each scientist as his/her reputation
   measure. We find a citation crossover c(x), which distinguishes the
   strength of the reputation effect. For publications with c < c(x), the
   author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate.
   Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage
   corresponding to roughly a 66\% increase in the citation rate for each
   tenfold increase in C-i. However, the reputation effect becomes
   negligible for highly cited publications meaning that, for c >= c(x),
   the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently. In
   addition, we have developed a stochastic reputation model, which is
   found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers,
   thus providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying
   cumulative advantage in science.},

Abstract = {Retracted papers often circulate widely on social media, digital news,
   and other websites before their official retraction. The spread of
   potentially inaccurate or misleading results from retracted papers can
   harm the scientific community and the public. Here, we quantify the
   amount and type of attention 3,851 retracted papers received over time
   in different online platforms. Comparing with a set of nonretracted
   control papers from the same journals with similar publication year,
   number of coauthors, and author impact, we show that retracted papers
   receive more attention after publication not only on social media but
   also, on heavily curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge
   repositories, amplifying the negative impact on the public. At the same
   time, we find that posts on Twitter tend to express more criticism about
   retracted than about control papers, suggesting that
   criticism-expressing tweets could contain factual information about
   problematic papers. Most importantly, around the time they are
   retracted, papers generate discussions that are primarily about the
   retraction incident rather than about research findings, showing that by
   this point, papers have exhausted attention to their results and
   highlighting the limited effect of retractions. Our findings reveal the
   extent to which retracted papers are discussed on different online
   platforms and identify at scale audience criticism toward them. In this
   context, we show that retraction is not an effective tool to reduce
   online attention to problematic papers.},

Abstract = {Sustainable city has been a global concern in recent years, involving
   natural science and social science research. However, few studies have
   attempted to map the global research of sustainable city. This study
   aimed to reveal the global performance and development of sustainable
   city research during 1992 to 2016, using a bibliometric analysis based
   on Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences
   Citation Index (SSCI) on Web of Science. Research performance, research
   emphases and trends were illustrated by bibliometric indicators and
   newly developed visualization tools, like Science of Science (Sci2),
   Gephi, and alluvial diagram. Sustainable city research in natural
   science and social science were well-matched in quantity, and had
   similar and different characteristics in teens of different investigated
   aspects. China ranked first in natural science research, while the USA
   was the leading country in social science research. More categories and
   clusters were involved in sustainable city field, indicating more
   interdisciplinary integration was undergoing. Energy and fuels in
   natural science field, and interdisciplinary applications mathematics in
   social science field started to attract more attention. Statistical
   analysis of words in title, author keywords, and Key Words Plus has been
   investigated to monitor the development of sustainable city research.
   Finally, three critical issues in sustainable city research based on the
   clues by the analysis of these keywords were reviewed and discussed. (C)

Abstract = {A central question in science of science concerns how time affects
   citations. Despite the long-standing interests and its broad impact, we
   lack systematic answers to this simple yet fundamental question. By
   reviewing and classifying prior studies for the past 50 years, we find a
   significant lack of consensus in the literature, primarily due to the
   coexistence of retrospective and prospective approaches to measuring
   citation age distributions. These two approaches have been pursued in
   parallel, lacking any known connections between the two. Here we
   developed a new theoretical framework that not only allows us to,connect
   the two approaches through precise mathematical relationships, it also
   helps us reconcile the interplay between temporal decay of citations and
   the growth of science, helping us uncover new functional forms
   characterizing citation age distributions. We find retrospective
   distribution follows a lognormal distribution with exponential cutoff,
   while prospective distribution is governed by the interplay between a
   lognormal distribution and the growth in the number of references. Most
   interestingly, the two approaches can be connected once rescaled by the
   growth of publications and citations. We further validate our framework
   using both large-scale citation datasets and analytical models capturing
   citation dynamics. Together this paper presents a comprehensive analysis
   of the time dimension of science, representing a new empirical and
   theoretical basis for all future studies in this area. (C) 2017 Elsevier

   that major advances in knowledge will transpire when scholars, while
   pursuing their research interests, also consider addressing the core
   problems confronting society. For a workable engaged agenda in science
   and technology studies, one that informs scholarship as well as shapes
   practice and policy, the traditional terms of engagement must be
   renegotiated to be more open and mutual than has historically
   characterized the nature of inquiry in this field. At the same time, it
   is essential to protect individual privacy and preserve government
   confidentiality. Yet there is a scientific possibility for and benefit
   to introducing more collaborative and deliberative research approaches
   between scholar and subject in ways that will not violate these
   first-order ethics. To make the case, this article discusses the
   possibilities and perils of engaged science and technology scholarship
   by drawing on our own recent experiences to conduct and apply STS
   research while embedded in the National Science Foundation. Brief
   accounts of these experiences reveal the opportunities as well as the
   challenges of engaged scholarship. They also provide lessons for those
   fellow travelers who might follow the authors to this or other like host
   organizations with ambitions of increasing fundamental knowledge about
   and applying research to the policies, programs, and decisions of the
   scientific enterprise.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to map the development of research on family
   business in tourism and hospitality and provides insights into the key
   contributors, key areas and current dynamics, and suggests future
   research directions in the field. Design/methodology/approach This study
   uses the Web of Science (WoS) database to identify the 124 articles
   published in the theme. The study uses bibliometric indicators such as
   the co-citation network, word co-occurrence network to analyze the
   publication and citation structure using Science of Science (Sci2),
   OpenRefine, and Gephi. Findings The top authors, top journals and major
   themes are recognized using bibliometric techniques. The study
   identifies six keyword clusters: entrepreneurship, innovation, and
   empirical collaborating with tourism, hospitality, and family business.
   The country-wise collaboration indicates the lack of research in the
   eastern hemisphere of the world. The co-authorship shows studies shared
   among individuals of a few organizations. The trends from bibliographic
   coupling depict the evolution of research. Research
   limitations/implications The scope of data collection for the network
   analysis is limited to the WoS. Incorporating papers from other
   databases might provide different network structures and insights.
   Originality/value The study is the first of its kind in the theme of
   family businesses in tourism and hospitality and will contribute to the
   literature by identifying future research directions.},

Abstract = {Understanding how institutional changes within academia may affect the
   overall potential of science requires a better quantitative
   representation of how careers evolve over time. Because knowledge
   spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are
   distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment
   relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating
   funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the
   annual production n(i)(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing
   longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant
   professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of
   individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing
   returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that
   (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic
   ``tent-shaped{''} distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our
   methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in
   other disciplines where academic publication is essential and
   collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional
   growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally
   accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career
   longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we
   show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition
   and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not
   necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but
   because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations
   in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's
   collaboration radius and team efficiency.},

Abstract = {Growth of science is a prevalent issue in science of science studies. In
   recent years, two new bibliographic databases have been introduced,
   which can be used to study growth processes in science from centuries
   back: Dimensions from Digital Science and Microsoft Academic. In this
   study, we used publication data from these new databases and added
   publication data from two established databases (Web of Science from
   Clarivate Analytics and Scopus from Elsevier) to investigate scientific
   growth processes from the beginning of the modern science system until
   today. We estimated regression models that included simultaneously the
   publication counts from the four databases. The results of the
   unrestricted growth of science calculations show that the overall growth
   rate amounts to 4.10\% with a doubling time of 17.3 years. As the
   comparison of various segmented regression models in the current study
   revealed, models with four or five segments fit the publication data
   best. We demonstrated that these segments with different growth rates
   can be interpreted very well, since they are related to either phases of
   economic (e.g., industrialization) and/or political developments (e.g.,
   Second World War). In this study, we additionally analyzed scientific
   growth in two broad fields (Physical and Technical Sciences as well as
   Life Sciences) and the relationship of scientific and economic growth in
   UK. The comparison between the two fields revealed only slight
   differences. The comparison of the British economic and scientific
   growth rates showed that the economic growth rate is slightly lower than
   the scientific growth rate.},

Title = {Authorship, institutional and citation metrics for publications on
   postmenopausal osteoporosis},
Journal = {OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone condition that does not
   often become clinically clear until a fracture occurs. The objective of
   the current study was to analyze all publications whose titles included
   the term ``postmenopausal osteoporosis{''} published during the past
   decade by journals indexed in the database of SCI-E.
   This paper analyzes two sets of data: in the first, all papers with
   ``postmenopausal osteoporosis{''} in their titles indexed in the
   database of SCI-E in the period 2001-2011; the second, all papers
   published by Osteoporosis International that were indexed in SCI-E
   during 2001-2011. The Science of Science Tool was used to map the
   co-authorship networks of papers published by Osteoporosis International
   in 2007-2011. Only papers cited more than 100 times in the Web of
   Science were considered for mapping the co-authorship network.
   A total number of 2,056 papers with ``postmenopausal osteoporosis{''} in
   their titles were indexed in SCI-E between 2001 and 2011. The annual
   number of publications increased during the study period. The majority
   of publications came from Western Europe and North America. The number
   of papers published by authors based in Western Europe was about 75\%
   greater than for North America.
   More papers on postmenopausal osteoporosis were published in Western
   Europe than in North America. The networks of co-authorship pointed to
   the strategic positions of highly cited authors from Western Europe. The
   top eight authors contributing the majority of papers were from Western
   Europe. Consequently Western Europe had greater impact than North
   America.},

Title = {Slowed canonical progress in large fields of science},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {118},
Number = {41},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has
   increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the
   quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which
   is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics
   determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of
   academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these
   increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into
   advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a
   theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a
   field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new
   papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to
   fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new
   ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a
   promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of
   this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a
   scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to
   already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new
   papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is
   not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and
   newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These
   findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be
   slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how
   scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be
   called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.},

Title = {Quantifying the cognitive extent of science},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {962-973},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {While the modern science is characterized by an exponential growth in
   scientific literature, the increase in publication volume clearly does
   not reflect the expansion of the cognitive boundaries of science.
   Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science
   or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity.
   Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science
   teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not
   necessarily mean that ``big science{''} leads to cognitive expansion.
   Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of
   cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature
   independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million
   articles published over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and
   biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of
   fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the
   method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve
   <1\% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not
   necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore,
   we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly
   smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from
   smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of
   small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive
   boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of
   the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects
   of `science of science.' (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {New trends in bibliometric APIs: A comparative analysis},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The science of science practice requires the analysis of large and
   complex bibliometric data. Traditional data exporting from companies'
   websites is not sufficient, so APIs are used to access a larger corpus.
   Therefore, this study aims not only to establish a taxonomy but also to
   offer a comparative analysis of 44 bibliographic APIs from various
   non-profit and commercial organizations, analyzing their characteristics
   and metadata with descriptive analysis, their possible bibliometric
   analyses, and the interoperability of the APIs across four different
   data categories: general, content, search, and query modes. The study
   found that Clarivate Analytics and Elsevier offer highly versatile APIs,
   while non-profit organizations, such as OpenCitations and OurResearch
   promote the Open Science philosophy. Most organizations offer free
   access to APIs for non-commercial purposes, but some have limitations on
   metadata retrieval. However, CrossRef, OpenCitations, or OpenAlex have
   no restrictions on the metadata retrieval. Co-author analysis using
   author names and bibliometric evaluation using citations are the types
   of analyses that can be done with the data provided by most APIs. DOI,
   PubMedID, and PMCID are the most versatile identifiers for extending
   metadata in the APIs. Semantic Scholar, Dimensions, ORCID, and Embase
   are the APIs that offer the most extensibility. Considering the obtained
   results, there is no single API that gathers all the information needed
   to perform any bibliometric analysis. Combining two or more APIs may be
   the most appropriate option to cover as much information as possible and
   enrich reports and analyses. This study contributes to advancing the
   understanding and use of APIs in research practice.},

Abstract = {Faculty at prestigious institutions produce more scientific papers,
   receive more citations and scholarly awards, and are typically trained
   at more-prestigious institutions than faculty with less prestigious
   appointments. This imbalance is often attributed to a meritocratic
   system that sorts individuals into more-prestigious positions according
   to their reputation, past achievements, and potential for future
   scholarly impact. Here, we investigate the determinants of scholarly
   productivity and measure their dependence on past training and current
   work environments. To distinguish the effects of these environments, we
   apply a matched-pairs experimental design to career and productivity
   trajectories of 2,453 early-career faculty at all 205 PhD-granting
   computer science departments in the United States and Canada, who
   together account for over 200,000 publications and 7.4 million
   citations. Our results show that the prestige of faculty's current work
   environment, not their training environment, drives their future
   scientific productivity, while current and past locations drive
   prominence. Furthermore, the characteristics of a work environment are
   more predictive of faculty productivity and impact than mechanisms
   representing preferential selection or retention of more-productive
   scholars by more-prestigious departments. These results identify an
   environmental mechanism for cumulative advantage, in which an
   individual's past successes are ``locked in{''} via placement into a
   more prestigious environment, which directly facilitates future success.
   The scientific productivity of early-career faculty is thus driven by
   where they work, rather than where they trained for their doctorate,
   indicating a limited role for doctoral prestige in predicting scientific
   contributions.},

Abstract = {Conjecture about the weak replicability in social sciences has made
   scholars eager to quantify the scale and scope of replication failure
   for a discipline. Yet small-scale manual replication methods alone are
   ill-suited to deal with this big data problem. Here, we conduct a
   discipline-wide replication census in science. Our sample (N = 14,126
   papers) covers nearly all papers published in the six top-tier
   Psychology journals over the past 20 y. Using a validated machine
   learning model that estimates a paper's likelihood of replication, we
   found evidence that both supports and refutes speculations drawn from a
   relatively small sample of manual replications. First, we find that a
   single overall rep-lication rate of Psychology poorly captures the
   varying degree of replicability among subfields. Second, we find that
   replication rates are strongly correlated with research methods in all
   subfields. Experiments replicate at a significantly lower rate than do
   non-experimental studies. Third, we find that authors' cumulative
   publication number and citation impact are positively related to the
   likelihood of replication, while other proxies of research quality and
   rigor, such as an author's university prestige and a paper's citations,
   are unrelated to replicability. Finally, contrary to the ideal that
   media attention should cover replicable research, we find that media
   attention is positively related to the likelihood of replication
   failure. Our assessments of the scale and scope of replicability are
   important next steps toward broadly resolving issues of replicability.},

Abstract = {The exponential increase in the number of scientific publications raises
   the question of whether the sciences are expanding into a fractured
   structure, making cross-field communication difficult. On the other
   hand, scientists may be motivated to learn extensively across fields to
   enhance their innovative capacity, and this may offset the negative
   effects of fragmentation. Through an investigation of the distances
   within and clustering of cross-sectional citation networks, this study
   presents evidence that fields of science become more integrated over
   time. The average citation distance between papers published in the same
   year decreased from similar to 5.33 to 3.18 steps between 1950 and 2018.
   This observation is attributed to the growth of cross-field
   communication throughout the entire period as well as the growing
   importance of high-impact papers to bridge networks in the same year.
   Three empirical findings support this conclusion. First, distances
   decreased between almost all disciplines throughout the time period.
   Second, inequality in the number of citations received by papers
   increased, and, as a consequence, the shortest paths in the network
   depend more on high-impact papers later in the period. Third, the
   dispersion of connections between fields increased continually.
   Moreover, these changes did not entail a lower level of clustering of
   citations. Both within- and cross-field citations show a similar rate of
   slowly growing clustering values in all years. The latter findings
   suggest that domain-spanning scholarly communication is partly enabled
   by new fields that connect disciplines.},

Title = {Predicting the results of evaluation procedures of academics},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Background. The 2010 reform of the Italian university system introduced
   the National Scientific Habilitation (ASN) as a requirement for applying
   to permanent professor positions. Since the CVs of the 59,149 candidates
   and the results of their assessments have been made publicly available,
   the ASN constitutes an opportunity to perform analyses about a
   nation-wide evaluation process.
   Objective. The main goals of this paper are: (i) predicting the ASN
   results using the information contained in the candidates' CVs; (ii)
   identifying a small set of quantitative indicators that can be used to
   perform accurate predictions.
   Approach. Semantic technologies are used to extract, systematize and
   enrich the information contained in the applicants' CVs, and machine
   learning methods are used to predict the ASN results and to identify a
   subset of relevant predictors.
   Results. For predicting the success in the role of associate professor,
   our best models using all and the top 15 predictors make accurate
   predictions (F-measure values higher than 0.6) in 88\% and 88.6\% of the
   cases, respectively. Similar results have been achieved for the role of
   full professor.
   Evaluation. The proposed approach outperforms the other models developed
   to predict the results of researchers' evaluation procedures.
   Conclusions. Such results allow the development of an automated system
   for supporting both candidates and committees in the future ASN sessions
   and other scholars' evaluation procedures.},

Abstract = {Power dynamics influence every aspect of scientific collaboration. Team
   power dynamics can be measured by team power level and team power
   hierarchy. Team power level is conceptualized as the average level of
   the possession of resources, expertise, or decision-making authorities
   of a team. Team power hierarchy represents the vertical differences of
   the possessions of resources in a team. In Science of Science, few
   studies have looked at scientific collaboration from the perspective of
   team power dynamics. This research examines how team power dynamics
   affect team impact to fill the research gap. In this research, all
   coauthors of one publication are treated as one team. Team power level
   and team power hierarchy of one team are measured by the mean and Gini
   index of career age of coauthors in this team. Team impact is quantified
   by citations of a paper authored by this team. By analyzing over 7.7
   million teams from Science (e.g., Computer Science, Physics), Social
   Sciences (e.g., Sociology, Library \& Information Science), and Arts \&
   Humanities (e.g., Art), we find that flat team structure is associated
   with higher team impact, especially when teams have high team power
   level. These findings have been repeated in all five disciplines except
   Art, and are consistent in various types of teams from Computer Science
   including teams from industry or academia, teams with different gender
   groups, teams with geographical contrast, and teams with distinct size.},

Abstract = {It is important to explore how scientists decide their research agenda
   and the corresponding consequences, as their decisions collectively
   shape contemporary science. There are studies focusing on the overall
   performance of individuals with different problem choosing strategies.
   Here we ask a slightly different but relatively unexplored question: how
   is a scientist's change of research agenda associated with her change of
   scientific performance. Using publication records of over 14,000 authors
   in physics, we quantitatively measure the extent of research direction
   change and the performance change of individuals. We identify a strong
   positive correlation between the direction change and impact change.
   Scientists with a larger direction change not only are more likely to
   produce works with increased scientific impact compared to their past
   ones, but also have a higher growth rate of scientific impact. On the
   other hand, the direction change is not associated with productivity
   change. Those who stay in familiar topics do not publish faster than
   those who venture out and establish themselves in a new field. The gauge
   of research direction in this work is uncorrelated with the diversity of
   research agenda and the switching probability among topics, capturing
   the evolution of individual careers from a new point of view. Though the
   finding is inevitably affected by the survival bias, it sheds light on a
   range of problems in the career development of individual scientists.},

Abstract = {We present a simple generalization of Hirsch's h-index, Z = root h(2) +
   C/root 5, where C is the total number of citations. Z is aimed at
   correcting the potentially excessive penalty made by h on a scientist's
   highly cited papers, because for the majority of scientists analyzed, we
   find the excess citation fraction (C - h(2))/C to be distributed closely
   around the value 0.75, meaning that 75\% of the author's impact is
   neglected. Additionally, Z is less sensitive to local changes in a
   scientist's citation profile, namely perturbations which increase h
   while only marginally affecting C. Using real career data for 476
   physicists careers and 488 biologist careers, we analyze both the
   distribution of Z and the rank stability of Z with respect to the Hirsch
   index h and the Egghe index g. We analyze careers distributed across a
   wide range of total impact, including top-cited physicists and
   biologists for benchmark comparison. In practice, the Z-index requires
   the same information needed to calculate h and could be effortlessly
   incorporated within career profile databases, such as Google Scholar and
   ResearcherID. Because Z incorporates information from the entire
   publication profile while being more robust than h and g to local
   perturbations, we argue that Z is better suited for ranking comparisons
   in academic decision-making scenarios comprising a large number of
   scientists. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Scale-free growth in regional scientific capacity building explains
   long-term scientific dominance},
Journal = {CHAOS SOLITONS \& FRACTALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {167},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The regional capability of performing front-running research and
   technological development has been identified as a necessary condition
   for future wealth creation. The quality and amount of scientific
   capabilities in specific fields vary dramatically across different world
   regions. Capabilities, knowledge, and skills are embodied by scientists
   working in research institutions or companies. The conditions for the
   emergence of a leading regional scientific environment - and the
   resulting early technological leadership - are poorly understood. The
   existence of a critical mass - the threshold above which a region can
   build comparably strong scientific capabilities - of scientists is often
   assumed. Using a unique dataset of global scientific activity and
   researcher mobility over several decades, we present empirical evidence
   in three scientific areas (semiconductor research, embryonic stem cells,
   and Internet research) that the process of scientific knowledge
   accumulation is remarkably general and applies to practically all
   regions. Regional knowledge accumulation data obtained from an analysis
   of scientists' geolocated trajectories follow a preferential attachment
   mechanism characterized by a sub-linear kernel with a robust growth
   exponent. Scale-free growth patterns suggest that regions that move
   early into new technologies tend to dominate the corresponding
   scientific fields. We find no evidence that critical mass is required to
   achieve prolonged scientific dominance. We propose a simple preferential
   attachment model that explains the empirical data and allows us to
   understand deviations from the growth exponent as focused interventions
   to strategically attract scientists at regional level. We demonstrate
   this explicitly for China in the three scientific fields examined.},

Abstract = {A scientist's choice of research problem affects his or her personal
   career trajectory. Scientists' combined choices affect the direction and
   efficiency of scientific discovery as a whole. In this paper, we infer
   preferences that shape problem selection from patterns of published
   findings and then quantify their efficiency. We represent research
   problems as links between scientific entities in a knowledge network. We
   then build a generative model of discovery informed by qualitative
   research on scientific problem selection. We map salient features from
   this literature to key network properties: an entity's importance
   corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem's difficulty
   corresponds to the network distance it spans. Drawing on millions of
   papers and patents published over 30 years, we use this model to infer
   the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in
   biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative research choices
   focused on building up knowledge around important molecules. These
   choices become more conservative over time. The observed strategy is
   efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific
   careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for science as a
   whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we
   study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more
   efficient at exploring mature knowledge networks. We find that increased
   risk-taking and the publication of experimental failures would
   substantially improve the speed of discovery. We consider institutional
   shifts in grant making, evaluation, and publication that would help
   realize these efficiencies.},

Abstract = {Progress in science has advanced the development of human society across
   history, with dramatic revolutions shaped by information theory, genetic
   cloning, and artificial intelligence, among the many scientific
   achievements produced in the 20th century. However, the way that science
   advances itself is much less well-understood. In this work, we study the
   evolution of scientific development over the past century by presenting
   an anatomy of 89 million digitalized papers published between 1900 and
   2015. We find that science has benefited from the shift from individual
   work to collaborative effort, with over 90\% of the world-leading
   innovations generated by collaborations in this century, nearly four
   times higher than they were in the 1900s. We discover that rather than
   the frequent myopic and self-referencing that was common in the early
   20th century, modern scientists instead tend to look for literature
   further back and farther around. Finally, we also observe the
   globalization of scientific development from 1900 to 2015, including
   25-fold and 7-fold increases in international collaborations and
   citations, respectively, as well as a dramatic decline in the dominant
   accumulation of citations by the US, the UK, and Germany, from similar
   to 95\% to similar to 50\% over the same period. Our discoveries are
   meant to serve as a starter for exploring the visionary ways in which
   science has developed throughout the past century, generating insight
   into and an impact upon the current scientific innovations and funding
   policies.},

Abstract = {The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary
   success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part
   of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have
   become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities
   worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed
   as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of
   integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for
   development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis
   across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of
   scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution,
   geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration
   structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing
   explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the
   field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their
   interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining
   contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at
   very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional
   disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and
   ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy
   perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives
   has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence
   of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments
   demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of
   sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous
   scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and
   longevity.},

Abstract = {Einstein believed that mentors are especially influential in a protege's
   intellectual development, yet the link between mentorship and protege
   success remains a mystery. We marshaled genealogical data on nearly
   40,000 scientists who published 1,167,518 papers in biomedicine,
   chemistry, math, or physics between 1960 and 2017 to investigate the
   relationship between mentorship and protege achievement. In our data, we
   find groupings of mentors with similar records and reputations who
   attracted proteges of similar talents and expected levels of
   professional success. However, each grouping has an exception: One
   mentor has an additional hidden capability that can be mentored to their
   proteges. They display skill in creating and communicating prizewinning
   research. Because the mentor's ability for creating and communicating
   celebrated research existed before the prize's conferment, proteges of
   future prizewinning mentors can be uniquely exposed to mentorship for
   conducting celebrated research. Our models explain 34-44\% of the
   variance in protege success and reveals three main findings. First,
   mentorship strongly predicts protege success across diverse disciplines.
   Mentorship is associated with a 2x-to4x rise in a protege's likelihood
   of prizewinning, National Academy of Science (NAS) induction, or
   superstardom relative to matched proteges. Second, mentorship is
   significantly associated with an increase in the probability of proteges
   pioneering their own research topics and being midcareer late bloomers.
   Third, contrary to conventional thought, proteges do not succeed most by
   following their mentors' research topics but by studying original topics
   and coauthoring no more than a small fraction of papers with their
   mentors.},

Journal = {POETICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Modern advances in transportation and communication technology from
   airplanes to the internet alongside global expansions of media,
   migration, and trade have made the modern world more connected than ever
   before. But what does this bode for the convergence of global culture?
   Here we explore the relationship between centralization in social
   networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity of semantic
   expressions such as ideas, opinions and tastes. We advance formal
   examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold
   learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations
   into comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively
   represent both hierarchy and diversity within a system. In a Poincare
   disk-a two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding-radius from center traces
   the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a semantic
   hierarchy. Angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors or
   ideas captures their diversity. We illustrate this method by examining
   the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity
   within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense,
   centralized collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of
   ideas and how these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and
   science. We discuss the complex of causes underlying this association,
   and theorize the dynamic interplay between structural centralization and
   semantic contraction, arguing that it introduces an essential tension
   between the supply and demand of difference.},

Abstract = {Interdisciplinary studies of science form a ``living{''} organism, in
   which every part performs its function and is connected with other
   parts. Philosophy of science plays a role of the ``think-tank{''} of
   that organism. It is a generator of the sense that connects the
   functions of its separate parts into a systematic unity. It can be
   called the consciousness of science. Metaphilosophy of science is
   related to philosophy of science in the same way as philosophy of
   science itself is related to science. Within metaphilosophy of science
   the propensity of philosophy of science to self-reflection is
   implemented. Metaphilosophy of science makes relevant the issues that
   relate to the philosophical significance of the processes taking place
   in the so-called ``trading zone{''} (in the sense of P. Galison). These
   trading zone is a place where scientists, science-of-science theorists
   and philosophers exchange their ideas. The interaction between
   philosophy and metaphilosophy of science takes place in the course of a
   competition among various philosophical interpretations of the results
   received within the studies of these ``trading{''} processes.
   Institutional, methodological, historical and culturological studies get
   a philosophical interpretation and become the source of
   metaphilosophical ideas. Metaphorically, one may say, that
   metaphilosophy of science is the self-consciousness of philosophy of
   science. The very idea that metaphilosophy of science is a participant
   of the process occurring in the ``trading zone{''} puts an end to a
   meaningless pile of ``metalevels{''} that very often characterize
   philosophical discussions of science.},

Abstract = {Rapid research progress in science and technology (S\&T) and
   continuously shifting workforce needs exert pressure on each other and
   on the educational and training systems that link them. Higher education
   institutions aim to equip new generations of students with skills and
   expertise relevant to workforce participation for decades to come, but
   their offerings sometimes misalign with commercial needs and new
   techniques forged at the frontiers of research. Here, we analyze and
   visualize the dynamic skill (mis-) alignment between academic push,
   industry pull, and educational offerings, paying special attention to
   the rapidly emerging areas of data science and data engineering (DS/DE).
   The visualizations and computational models presented here can help key
   decision makers understand the evolving structure of skills so that they
   can craft educational programs that serve workforce needs. Our study
   uses millions of publications, course syllabi, and job advertisements
   published between 2010 and 2016. We show how courses mediate between
   research and jobs. We also discover responsiveness in the academic,
   educational, and industrial system in how skill demands from industry
   are as likely to drive skill attention in research as the converse.
   Finally, we reveal the increasing importance of uniquely human skills,
   such as communication, negotiation, and persuasion. These skills are
   currently underexamined in research and undersupplied through education
   for the labor market. In an increasingly data-driven economy, the demand
   for ``soft{''} social skills, like teamwork and communication, increase
   with greater demand for ``hard{''} technical skills and tools.},

Title = {Information entropy and power-law distributions for chaotic systems},
Journal = {PHYSICA A},

Abstract = {The power law is found for density distributions for the chaotic systems
   of most different nature (physical, geophysical, biological, economical,
   social, etc.) on the basis of the maximum entropy principle for the
   Renyi entropy. Its exponent q is expressed as a function q(beta) of the
   Renyi parameter beta. The difference between the Renyi and
   Boltzmann-Shannon entropies (a modified Lyapunov functional Lambda(R))
   for the same power-law distribution is negative and as a function of
   beta has a well-defined minimum at beta{*} which remains within the
   narrow range from 1.5 to 3 when varying other characteristic parameters
   of any concrete systems. Relevant variations of the exponent q(beta{*})
   are found within the range 1-3.5. The same range of observable values of
   q is typical for the various applications where the power-law
   distribution takes glace. It is known under the following names:
   ``triangular or trapezoidal{''} (in physics and technics),
   ``Gutenberg-Richter law{''} (in geophysics), ``Zipf-Pareto law{''} (in
   economies and the humanities), ``Lotka low{''} (in science of science),
   etc. As the negative Lambda(R) indicates self-organisation of the
   system, the negative minimum of Lambda(R) corresponds to the most
   self-organised state. Thus, the comparison between the calculated range
   of variations of q(beta{*}) and observable values of the exponent q
   testifies that the most self-organised states are as a rule realised
   regardless of the nature of a chaotic system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Journal = {EPJ DATA SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Current practices of quantifying academic performance by productivity
   raise serious concerns about the psychological well-being of graduate
   students. These efforts often neglect the influence of researchers'
   environment. Acknowledgments in dissertation subsections shed light on
   this environment by providing an opportunity for students to thank the
   people who supported them. We analysed 26,236 acknowledgments to create
   an ``academic support network{''} that reveals five distinct communities
   that support students along the way: Academic, Administration, Family,
   Friends \& Colleagues, and Spiritual. We show that female students
   mention fewer people from each of these communities, with the exception
   of their families, and that their productivity is slightly lower than
   that of males when considering the number of publications alone. This is
   critically important because it means that studying the doctoral process
   may help us better understand the adverse conditions women face early in
   their academic careers. Our results also suggest that the total number
   of people mentioned in the acknowledgements allows disciplines to be
   categorised as either individual science or team science as their
   magnitudes change. We also show that male students who mention more
   people from their academic community are associated with higher levels
   of productivity. University rankings are found to be positively
   correlated with productivity and the size of academic support networks.
   However, neither university rankings nor students' productivity levels
   correlate with the sentiments students express in their
   acknowledgements. Our results point to the importance of academic
   support networks by explaining how they differ and how they influence
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify embedded communities
   among Medical Ethics scholars in France based on their position and
   strength of association in the social networks they form.
   Design/methodology/approach The author constructed a co-authorship
   network by linking two authors if they co-authored a paper. Once the
   co-authorship network was constructed, the author investigated the
   entire network quantitatively using standard research methods known as
   social network analysis. The author's mechanism of community detection
   was via identification, i.e. communities were user-defined based on
   topological analysis.
   Findings The study identified that communities formed by trust (bonding
   or repeat connections) or by prestige (connection of well-connected
   scholars with those that are already well-connected) overlap each other,
   suggesting that trust and prestige may go hand in hand in sustaining
   communities. Structural holes within trust networks indicated that some
   actors played more of a broker role than did other actors.
   Research limitations/implications The study uses Web of Science field
   based category to extract data. Although thorough cleaning of data has
   been performed, author disambiguation over a three decade period remains
   a limitation.
   Originality/value Although there have been numerous studies on mapping
   co-authorship networks, there has been limited work investigating the
   underlying communities formed by author associations. The results of
   this study should be of immense benefit to those studying the science of
   science and S\&T policy.},

Title = {Identifying translational science through embeddings of controlled

Abstract = {Objective: Translational science aims at ``translating{''} basic
   scientific discoveries into clinical applications. The identification of
   translational science has practicality such as evaluating the
   effectiveness of investments made into large programs like the Clinical
   and Translational Science Awards. Despite several proposed methods that
   group publications-the primary unit of research output-into some
   categories, we still lack a quantitative way to place articles onto the
   full, continuous spectrum from basic research to clinical medicine.
   Materials and Methods: I learn vector representations of controlled
   vocabularies assigned to Medline articles to obtain a translational axis
   that points from basic science to clinical medicine. The projected
   position of a term on the translational axis, expressed by a continuous
   quantity, indicates the term's ``appliedness.{''} The position of an
   article, determined by the average location over its terms, quantifies
   the degree of its appliedness, which I term the level score.
   Results: I validate the present method by comparing with previous
   techniques, showing excellent agreement yet uncovering significant
   variations of scores of articles in previously defined categories. The
   measure allows us to characterize the standing of journals, disciplines,
   and the entire biomedical literature along the basic-applied spectrum.
   Analysis on large-scale citation network reveals 2 main findings. First,
   direct citations mainly occurred between articles with similar scores.
   Second, shortest paths are more likely ended up with an article closer
   to the basic end of the spectrum, regardless of where the starting
   article is on the spectrum.
   Conclusions: The proposed method provides a quantitative way to identify
   translational science.},

Abstract = {For decades the number of scientific publications has been rapidly
   increasing, effectively out-dating knowledge at a tremendous rate. Only
   few scientific milestones remain relevant and continuously attract
   citations. Here we quantify how long scientific work remains being
   utilized, how long it takes before today's work is forgotten, and how
   milestone papers differ from those forgotten. To answer these questions,
   we study the complete temporal citation network of all American Physical
   Society journals. We quantify the probability of attracting citations
   for individual publications based on age and the number of citations
   they have received in the past. We capture both aspects, the forgetting
   and the tendency to cite already popular works, in a microscopic
   generative model for the dynamics of scientific citation networks. We
   find that the probability of citing a specific paper declines with age
   as a power law with an exponent of alpha similar to -1.4. Whenever a
   paper in its early years can be characterized by a scaling exponent
   above a critical value, alpha (c), the paper is likely to become
   `ever-lasting'. We validate the model with out-of-sample predictions,
   with an accuracy of up to 90\% (area under the curve similar to 0.9).
   The model also allows us to estimate an expected citation landscape of
   the future, predicting that 95\% of papers cited in 2050 have yet to be
   published. The exponential growth of articles, combined with a power-law
   type of forgetting and papers receiving fewer and fewer citations on
   average, suggests a worrying tendency toward information overload and
   raises concerns about scientific publishing's long-term sustainability.},

Title = {Scholarly migration within Mexico: analyzing internal migration among
   researchers using Scopus longitudinal bibliometric data},
Journal = {EPJ DATA SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The migration of scholars is a major driver of innovation and of
   diffusion of knowledge. Although large-scale bibliometric data have been
   used to measure international migration of scholars, our understanding
   of internal migration among researchers is very limited. This is partly
   due to a lack of data aggregated at a suitable sub-national level. In
   this study, we analyze internal migration in Mexico based on over 1.1
   million authorship records from the Scopus database. We trace the
   movements of scholars between Mexican states, and provide key
   demographic measures of internal migration for the 1996-2018 period.
   From a methodological perspective, we develop a new framework for
   enhancing data quality, inferring states from affiliations, and
   detecting moves from modal states for the purposes of studying internal
   migration among researchers. Substantively, we combine demographic and
   network science techniques to improve our understanding of internal
   migration patterns within country boundaries. The migration patterns
   between states in Mexico appear to be heterogeneous in size and
   direction across regions. However, while many scholars remain in their
   regions, there seems to be a preference for Mexico City and the
   surrounding states as migration destinations. We observed that over the
   past two decades, there has been a general decreasing trend in the crude
   migration intensity. However, the migration network has become more
   dense and more diverse, and has included greater exchanges between
   states along the Gulf and the Pacific Coast. Our analysis, which is
   mostly empirical in nature, lays the foundations for testing and
   developing theories that can rely on the analytical framework developed
   by migration scholars, and the richness of appropriately processed
   bibliometric data.},

Abstract = {In this article, we show the results of a quantitative and qualitative
   analysis of open citations on a popular and highly cited retracted
   paper: ``Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and
   pervasive developmental disorder in children{''} by Wakefield et al.,
   published in 1998. The main purpose of our study is to understand the
   behavior of the publications citing one retracted article and the
   characteristics of the citations the retracted article accumulated over
   time. Our analysis is based on a methodology which illustrates how we
   gathered the data, extracted the topics of the citing articles and
   visualized the results. The data and services used are all open and free
   to foster the reproducibility of the analysis. The outcomes concerned
   the analysis of the entities citing Wakefield et al.'s article and their
   related in-text citations. We observed a constant increasing number of
   citations in the last 20 years, accompanied with a constant increment in
   the percentage of those acknowledging its retraction. Citing articles
   have started either discussing or dealing with the retraction of
   Wakefield et al.'s article even before its full retraction happened in
   2010. Articles in the social sciences domain citing the Wakefield et
   al.'s one were among those that have mostly discussed its retraction. In
   addition, when observing the in-text citations, we noticed that a large
   number of the citations received by Wakefield et al.'s article has
   focused on general discussions without recalling strictly medical
   details, especially after the full retraction. Medical studies did not
   hesitate in acknowledging the retraction of the Wakefield et al.'s
   article and often provided strong negative statements on it.},

Abstract = {Objective: Clinical trials ensure that pharmaceutical treatments are
   safe, efficacious, and effective for public consumption, but are
   extremely complex, taking up to 10 years and \$2.6 billion to complete.
   One main source of complexity arises from the collaboration between
   actors, and network science methodologies can be leveraged to explore
   that complexity. We aim to characterize collaborations between actors in
   the clinical trials context and investigate trends of successful actors.
   Materials and Methods: We constructed a temporal network of clinical
   trial collaborations between large and small-size pharmaceutical
   companies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, hospital
   systems, and government agencies from public and proprietary data and
   introduced metrics to quantify actors' collaboration network structure,
   organizational behavior, and partnership characteristics. A
   multivariable regression analysis was conducted to determine the
   metrics' relationship with success.
   Results: We found a positive correlation between the number of
   successful approved trials and interdisciplinary collaborations measured
   by a collaboration diversity metric (P< .01). Our results also showed a
   negative effect of the local clustering coefficient (P< .01) on the
   success of clinical trials. Large pharmaceutical companies have the
   lowest local clustering coefficient and more diversity in partnerships
   across biomedical specializations.
   Conclusions: Large pharmaceutical companies are more likely to
   collaborate with a wider range of actors from other specialties,
   especially smaller industry actors who are newcomers in clinical
   research, resulting in exclusive access to smaller actors. Future
   investigations are needed to show how concentrations of influence and
   resources might result in diminished gains in treatment development.},

Title = {Disruptive coefficient and 2-step disruptive coefficient: Novel measures
   for identifying vital nodes in complex networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},

Abstract = {The identification and ranking of vital nodes in complex networks have
   been a critical issue for a long time. In this paper, we present an
   extension of existing disruptive metrics and introduce new ones, namely
   the disruptive coefficient (D) and 2-step disruptive coefficient (2-step
   D), as innovative tools for identifying critical nodes in complex
   networks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of disruptiveness in
   characterizing nodes within the network and detecting their criticality.
   Our new measures take into account both prior and posterior information
   of the fo-cal nodes, by evaluating their ability to disrupt the previous
   network paradigm, setting them apart from traditional measures. We
   conduct an empirical analysis of four real-world networks to compare the
   rankings or identification of nodes using D and 2stepD with those
   obtained from four renowned benchmark measures, namely, degree, h-index,
   PageRank, and the CD index. Our analysis reveals significant differences
   between the nodes identified by D and 2stepD and those identified by the
   benchmark measures. We also examine the correlation coefficient and
   efficiency of the metrics and find that D and 2stepD have significant
   correlations with the CD index, but have weak correlations with the
   benchmark measures. Furthermore, we show that D and 2stepD outperform CD
   index and random ways in intentional attacks. We find power law
   distributions for D, 2stepD, and CD, indicating a small number of highly
   disruptive nodes and a large number of less disruptive nodes in the
   networks. Our results suggest that D and 2stepD are capable of providing
   valuable and distinct insights for identifying critical nodes in complex
   networks.},

Title = {Global performance and trends of research on per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs) between 2001 and 2018 using bibliometric analysis},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used in food
   packaging, non-stick pots, and surfactants. However, their persistence
   in the environment, hazardous nature, and potential for bioaccumulation
   and longrange transport have alarmed an increasing number of scholars
   and research institutions. Although several literature reviews on PFASs
   research exist, only a few of them have considered bibliometric indices.
   In this study, 3,373 PFASs-related articles published between 2001 and
   2018 were analyzed using a bibliometric analysis method based on the
   Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded. The software tools for mapping
   knowledge domain (MKD) (VOSviewer and Science of Science (Sci2)) were
   used to analyze the performance of contributors and PFASs research
   topics, hotspots, and trends. Our results reveal that the number of
   PFASs-related articles published annually has increased significantly,
   with most originating from the United States (followed by those from
   China). The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published the most articles.
   A comprehensive analysis of title, keywords, and keywords plus showed
   that PFASs research hotspots include humans, precursors, and detection
   methods, with the main focuses being environmental science, toxicology,
   and environmental engineering. The four main research topics of PFASs
   were identified, and a literature review was carried out for each one.
   Overall, this study can supply researchers with a deeper understanding
   of the development of PFASs studies and provide a comprehensive data
   reference for researchers to further grasp the research direction in
   this field.},

Abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines are
   notorious for gender imbalance favouring men. From these, Computer
   Science appears to among the worst. The imbalance comes despite the fact
   that, the proportion of women publishing impactful papers has increased
   over the last couple of decades. Here, we explore the potential gender
   differences in collaboration dynamics of leading academics in Computer
   Science and contrast it with other researchers in the same discipline.
   This work aims to demonstrate that productivity patterns differ between
   men and women; understanding such patterns is fundamental to improving
   the current situation by driving well-thought interventions. We start by
   looking at topological features of academics ego-networks and their
   variability over their career lifespan; we found that women have a
   higher rate of repeated collaborators, while men have slightly more new
   collaborators. Second, we show gender differences in the acquisition
   patterns and maintenance of collaborations over the researchers'
   careers. Third, we look at alters' gender composition and gender role in
   introducing new collaborations to researchers and found that women are
   more homophilic than men and that the gender of the person being
   introduced (alter) tends to match the gender of the ego (the
   researcher). Last, we show that women reach their highest productivity
   levels earlier in their careers than men, but the levels attained are
   not at the same magnitude as men. Our work highlights the importance of
   studying gender differences by productivity levels, the role of
   gender-mixed groups in academia and the relation to academic production
   within these groups. This work contributes to a better understanding of
   gender roles in Computer Science and points to ways that can help reduce
   possible gaps.},

Title = {Medical science in the light of the holocaust: Departing from a post-war
   paper by Ludwik Fleck},

Abstract = {In scholarly debates, Ludwik Fleck's post-war paper `Problemy
   naukoznawstwa {[}Problems of the Science of Science]', published in
   1946, has been taken unanimously to illustrate the epistemology
   expounded in his monograph Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact.
   The paper has also been seen to support parts of the received view of
   Fleck, notably that he manufactured an anti-typhus vaccine while
   imprisoned in Buchenwald. However, a different narrative emerges when
   comparing Fleck's paper with other accounts, also published in 1946 and
   written by other prisoners alluded to by Fleck in his paper. The
   situation is further complicated by four papers, published in
   prestigious scientific journals between 1942 and 1945, by the German
   medical leader of the typhus studies accounted for by Fleck. In
   addition, a thus-far neglected paper by Fleck, published in 1946 and
   summarizing his observations on typhus, discloses his role in the
   Buchenwald studies. Despite the obvious difficulties with tracing the
   history behind these works, notably the one on Nazi science, the
   contention is that what was attempted in Buchenwald in the name of
   science amounted to pseudoscience. This conclusion is amply supported
   not only by the accounts given by Fleck's fellow prisoners, but also by
   his own post-war paper on typhus. Based on the above findings, it is
   suggested that the mythology about Fleck, established in the 1980s, has
   been accomplished by a selective reading of his papers and also that the
   role played by Fleck was more complex than has so far been contemplated.},

Abstract = {Over the last century scientific research has become an increasingly
   collaborative endeavor. Commentators have pointed to different factors
   which contribute to this trend, including the specialization of science
   and growing need for diversity of interest and expertise areas in a
   scientific team. Very few studies, however, have precisely evaluated how
   the diversity of interest topics between researchers is related to the
   emergence of collaboration. Existing theoretical arguments suggest a
   curvilinear relationship between topic similarity and collaboration: too
   little similarity can complicate communication and agreement, yet too
   much overlap can increase competition and limit the potential for
   synergy. We test this idea using data on six years of publications
   across all disciplines at a large U.S. research university
   (approximately 14,300 articles, 12,500 collaborations, and 3400
   authors). Employing topic modelling and network statistical models, we
   analyze the relationship between topic overlap and the likelihood of
   coauthorship between two researchers while controlling for potential
   confounders. We find an inverted-U relationship in which the probability
   of collaboration initially increases with topic similarity, then rapidly
   declines after peaking at a similarity ``sweet spot{''}. Collaboration
   is most likely at low-to-moderate levels of topic overlap, which are
   substantially lower than the average self-similarity of scientists or
   research groups. These findings-which we replicate for different units
   of analysis (individuals and groups), genders of collaborators,
   disciplines, and collaboration types (intra-and
   interdisciplinary)-support the notion that researchers seek
   collaborators to augment their scientific and technical human capital.
   We discuss implications for theories of scientific collaboration and
   research policy.

Title = {Link Prediction of Weighted Triples for Knowledge Graph Completion
   Within the Scholarly Domain},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {116002-116014},
Abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used for modeling scholarly
   communication, performing scientometric analyses, and supporting a
   variety of intelligent services to explore the literature and predict
   research dynamics. However, they often suffer from incompleteness (e.g.,
   missing affiliations, references, research topics), leading to a reduced
   scope and quality of the resulting analyses. This issue is usually
   tackled by computing knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and applying link
   prediction techniques. However, only a few KGE models are capable of
   taking weights of facts in the knowledge graph into account. Such
   weights can have different meanings, e.g. describe the degree of
   association or the degree of truth of a certain triple. In this paper,
   we propose the Weighted Triple Loss, a new loss function for KGE models
   that takes full advantage of the additional numerical weights on facts
   and it is even tolerant to incorrect weights. We also extend the Rule
   Loss, a loss function that is able to exploit a set of logical rules, in
   order to work with weighted triples. The evaluation of our solutions on
   several knowledge graphs indicates significant performance improvements
   with respect to the state of the art. Our main use case is the
   large-scale AIDA knowledge graph, which describes 21 million research
   articles. Our approach enables to complete information about affiliation
   types, countries, and research topics, greatly improving the scope of
   the resulting scientometrics analyses and providing better support to
   systems for monitoring and predicting research dynamics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I draw on philosophy of science to address a challenge
   for science communication. Empirical research indicates that some people
   who trust a meteorologists report that they are in the path of a storm
   do not trust a climate scientists report that we are on a path to global
   warming. Such selective skepticism about climate science exemplifies a
   more general challenge:
   The Challenge of Selective Uptake
   Laypersons who generally accept public scientific testimony nevertheless
   fail to accept public scientific testimony concerning select, equally
   well warranted, scientific hypotheses.
   A prominent response arising from the novel interdisciplinary science of
   science communication is a principle called Consensus Reporting.
   According to this principle, science reporters should, whenever
   feasible, report the scientific consensus or lack thereof for a reported
   scientific view.
   However, philosophy of science may offer a different perspective on the
   issue. This perspective is critical insofar as it indicates some
   inadequacies of Consensus Reporting. But it is also constructive insofar
   as it guides the development of an alternative principle, Justification
   Reporting, according to which science reporters should, whenever
   feasible, report aspects of the nature and strength of scientific
   justification or lack thereof for a reported scientific view. A central
   difference between these proposals is that Consensus Reporting appeals
   to the authority of the scientists whereas Justification Reporting
   appeals to the authority of scientific justification. As such,
   Justification Reporting reflects the image of science.
   The paper considers the philosophical and empirical motivation for
   Justification Reporting and its limitations. This includes prospects and
   problems for implementing it in a way that addresses The Challenge of
   Selective Uptake. From a methodological point of view, the paper
   illustrates how empirically informed philosophy of science may help
   address challenges for science communication.},

Abstract = {As the field of neuroimaging grows, it can be difficult for scientists
   within the field to gain and maintain a detailed understanding of its
   ever-changing landscape. While collaboration and citation networks
   highlight important contributions within the field, the roles of and
   relations among specific areas of study can remain quite opaque. Here,
   we apply techniques from network science to map the landscape of
   neuroimaging research documented in the journal NeuroImage over the past
   decade. We create a network in which nodes represent research topics,
   and edges give the degree to which these topics tend to be covered in
   tandem. The network displays small-world architecture, with communities
   characterized by common imaging modalities and medical applications, and
   with hubs that integrate these distinct subfields. Using node-level
   analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within
   the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within
   the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among
   topics related to psychiatry. The overall prevalence of a topic is
   unrelated to the prevalence of its neighbors, but the degree to which a
   topic becomes more or less popular over time is strongly related to
   changes in the prevalence of its neighbors. Finally, we incorporate data
   from PNAS to investigate whether it serves as a trend-setter for topics'
   use within NeuroImage. We find that popularity trends are correlated
   across the two journals, and that changes in popularity tend to occur
   earlier within PNAS among growing topics. Broadly, this work presents a
   cohesive model for understanding the emergent relationships and dynamics
   of research topics within NeuroImage.},

Title = {Exploring the direction and diversity of interdisciplinary knowledge
   diffusion: A case study of professor Zeyuan Liu's scientific

Abstract = {Inspired by the concept of ``potential energy{''} in physics, we propose
   a new indicator to measure the ``direction{''} of interdisciplinary
   knowledge diffusion named ``disciplinary potential energy{''} (DPE). We
   also used the Shannon entropy to measure the ``diversity{''} of
   interdisciplinary knowledge diffusion. In memory of Professor Zeyuan
   Liu, a pioneer in the field of science of science (SoS) in China, we
   measured the direction and diversity of his interdisciplinary knowledge
   diffusion, based on his 371 publications and subsequent citations in the
   China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and 236 journal
   articles and subsequent citations in the Chinese Social Science Citation
   Index (CSSCI) database, respectively. The findings are (1) the newly
   proposed indicator that has advantages over previous interdisciplinary
   indicators characterizing the relative location of each discipline in
   the knowledge flow, through both direct and indirect citations; (2)
   particular importance was attached to Liu's contributions to management
   science (focusing on SoS) and philosophy (focusing on philosophy of
   science and technology) because of the ``reverse-flow{''} of his
   knowledge from ``net-inflow{''} disciplines to ``net-outflow{''}
   disciplines, although his contributions covered at least four
   disciplines, namely management science, economics (focusing on technical
   economics), philosophy, and engineering; and (3) Liu's research has had
   ever-increasing influence on management science over the past decade,
   while his interdisciplinary citation influence decreased in economics,
   philosophy and engineering. This study not only demonstrates how
   extensive Liu's knowledge contributions have been to Chinese academia.
   We also shed light on the methodology to measure interdisciplinary
   knowledge diffusion.},

Title = {Interdisciplinarity and insularity in the diffusion of knowledge: an
   analysis of disciplinary boundaries between philosophy of science and
   the sciences},

Abstract = {Two fundamentally different perspectives on knowledge diffusion dominate
   debates about academic disciplines. On the one hand, critics of
   disciplinary research and education have argued that disciplines are
   isolated silos, within which specialists pursue inward-looking and
   increasingly narrow research agendas. On the other hand, critics of the
   silo argument have demonstrated that researchers constantly import and
   export ideas across disciplinary boundaries. These perspectives have
   different implications for how knowledge diffuses, how intellectuals
   gain and lose status within their disciplines, and how intellectual
   reputations evolve within and across disciplines. We argue that highly
   general claims about the nature of disciplinary boundaries are
   counterproductive, and that research on the nature of specific
   disciplinary boundaries is more useful. To that end, this paper uses a
   novel publication and citation network dataset and statistical models of
   citation networks to test hypotheses about the boundaries between
   philosophy of science and 11 disciplinary clusters. Specifically, we
   test hypotheses about whether engaging with and being cited by
   scientific communities outside philosophy of science has an impact on
   one's position within philosophy of science. Our results suggest that
   philosophers of science produce interdisciplinary scholarship, but they
   tend not to cite work by other philosophers when it is published in
   journals outside of their discipline. Furthermore, net of other factors,
   receiving citations from other disciplines has no meaningful
   impact-positive or negative-on citations within philosophy of science.
   We conclude by considering this evidence for simultaneous
   interdisciplinarity and insularity in terms of scientific trading theory
   and other work on disciplinary boundaries and communication.},

Abstract = {The international migration of researchers is an important dimension of
   scientific mobility, and has been the subject of considerable policy
   debate. However, tracking the migration life courses of researchers is
   challenging due to data limitations. In this study, we use Scopus
   bibliometric data on eight million publications from 1.1 million
   researchers who have published at least once with an affiliation address
   from Germany in 1996-2020. We construct the partial life histories of
   published researchers in this period and explore both their
   out-migration and the subsequent return of a subset of this group: the
   returnees. Our analyses shed light on the career stages and gender
   disparities between researchers who remain in Germany, those who
   emigrate, and those who eventually return. We find that the return
   migration streams are even more gender imbalanced, which points to the
   need for additional efforts to encourage female researchers to come back
   to Germany. We document a slightly declining trend in return migration
   among more recent cohorts of researchers who left Germany, which, for
   most disciplines, was associated with a decrease in the German
   collaborative ties of these researchers. Moreover, we find that the
   gender disparities for the most gender imbalanced disciplines are
   unlikely to be mitigated by return migration given the gender
   compositions of the cohorts of researchers who have left Germany and of
   those who have returned. This analysis uncovers new dimensions of
   migration among scholars by investigating the return migration of
   published researchers, which is critical for the development of science
   policy.},

Abstract = {International mobility facilitates the exchange of scientific,
   institutional and cultural knowledge. Yet whether globalization and
   advances in virtual communication technologies have altered the impact
   of researcher mobility is a relevant and open question that we address
   by analysing a broad international set of 26 170 physicists from 1980 to
   2009, focusing on the 10-year period centred around each mobility event
   to assess the impact of mobility on research outcomes. We account for
   secular globalization trends by splitting the analysis into three
   periods, measuring for each period the effect of mobility on
   researchers' citation impact, research topic diversity, collaboration
   networks and geographical coordination. In order to identify causal
   effects we leverage statistical matching methods that pair mobile
   researchers with non-mobile researchers that are similar in research
   profile attributes prior the mobility event. We find that mobile
   researchers gain up to a 17\% increase in citations relative to their
   non-mobile counterparts, which can be explained by the simultaneous
   increase in their diversity of co-authors, topics and geographical
   coordination in the period immediately following migration.
   Nevertheless, we also observe that researcher's completely curtail prior
   collaborations with their source country in 11\% of the cross-border
   mobility events. As such, these individual-level perturbations fuel
   multiscale churning in scientific networks, e.g. rewiring the
   connectivity of individuals and ideas and affecting international
   integration. Together these results provide additional clarity on the
   complex relationship between human capital mobility and the dynamics of
   social capital investment, with implications for immigration and
   national innovation system policy.},

Title = {Messaging on Slow Impacts: Applying Lessons Learned from Climate Change
   Communication to Catalyze and Improve Marine Nutrient Communication},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Building publics' understanding about human-environmental causes and
   impacts of nutrient pollution is difficult due to the diverse sources
   and, at times, extended timescales of increasing inputs, consequences to
   ecosystems, and recovery after remediation. Communicating environmental
   problems with ``slow impacts{''} has long been a challenge for
   scientists, public health officials, and science communicators, as the
   time delay for subsequent consequences to become evident dilutes the
   sense of urgency to act. Fortunately, scientific research and practice
   in the field of climate change communication has begun to identify best
   practices to address these challenges. Climate change demonstrates a
   delay between environmental stressor and impact, and recommended
   practices for climate change communication illustrate how to explain and
   motivate action around this complex environmental problem. Climate
   change communication research provides scientific understanding of how
   people evaluate risk and scientific information about climate change. We
   used a qualitative coding approach to review the science communication
   and climate change communication literature to identify approaches that
   could be used for nutrients and how they could be applied. Recognizing
   the differences between climate change and impacts of nutrient
   pollution, we also explore how environmental problems with delayed
   impacts demand nuanced strategies for effective communication and public
   engagement. Applying generalizable approaches to successfully
   communicate the slow impacts related to nutrient pollution across
   geographic contexts will help build publics' understanding and urgency
   to act on comprehensive management of nutrient pollution, thereby
   increasing protection of coastal and marine environments.},

Title = {Development of a new theory with generality to unify diverse disciplines
   of knowledge and capability of applications},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {221-239},
Abstract = {It is shown that ideas and methods of the axiomatic set theory, based
   upon ZFC axiom system can be used to establish a more powerful theory,
   named systems analysis. This new theory unifies different research
   interests, including topology and algebra, into one. It is not only a
   theory with its own meaning of existence, but also one with extremely
   interesting applications. As examples, the following recent applications
   are listed: (1) how to reduce the dimension of a system of ordinary
   differential equations to I-dimension; (2) how Axiom of Regularity
   implies the existence of basic particles; (3) relation between Russell's
   paradox and the theory of science of science; (4) Delta-lemma and a new
   understanding of a social phenomenon; (5) why mathematics is so
   `'unreasonably effective'' in applications; (6) an impassable chasm is
   found between pure and applied mathematics; (7) an example, called vase
   puzzle, is given to show how different mathematical methods can lead to
   contradictory conclusions; (8) how Bellman's principle of optimality is
   incorrect and how a sufficient condition can be derived, under which the
   principle holds; (9) what impact the new theory has over some
   longstanding philosophical problems. In the last section, open questions
   are posed for future research. Seeking the answers to these questions
   will lead to both a more mature theory of systems analysis and more
   advanced applications in different areas, such as sociology, philosophy,
   epistemology, optimization theory, applied mathematics, material
   structure of learning, etc.},

Title = {Non-White scientists appear on fewer editorial boards, spend more time
   under review, and receive fewer citations},

   AMERICA},

Abstract = {Disparities continue to pose major challenges in various aspects of
   science. One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been
   shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the
   literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the
   degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of
   scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include
   the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and
   the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar
   papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we
   compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by
   six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper.
   Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and
   South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically
   non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their
   share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as
   the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find,
   again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time
   compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same
   year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors
   suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of
   US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive
   significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar
   research. Taken together, these findings highlight significant
   challenges facing non-White scientists.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we aim at examining whether there is a two-way
   interactive effect between scientific instruments (si) and scientific
   publications (sp) by employing the Granger Causality Test. As scientists
   explore the world, and indeed the universe, more and more deeply, new
   demands are constantly made for innovations in scientific instruments.
   More advanced scientific instruments, in turn, promote greater advances
   in the underlying science. Although the relationship between
   developments in scientific instruments and advances in science is
   intuitive, it has not been estimated statistically. Gaining a better
   empirical understanding of this relationship is, therefore, important to
   the science of science. Previous studies have not revealed whether there
   is a measurable interactive effect between them. To fill this gap in the
   research, we collected 42 years of data on the number of global
   scientific instrument patents and 42 years of data on the number of
   scientific research papers, both during the period 1980-2021. We take
   the logs of these counts (lnsi and lnsp) and perform time-series
   analyses of the two data sets. The Granger Causality Test is then
   employed to ascertain whether there exists an observable mutual
   association between the two time-series. The Granger Causality Test
   reveals, with a very high degree of confidence, a mutual predictive
   relationship between them. Stated differently, each time-series appears
   to ``forecast{''} the other, with different time lags. A number of the
   Granger Causality Tests based on the characteristics of si/ sp disclose
   that the interaction between si and sp also applies to the mutual effect
   between the characteristics of si and sp, with different lag lengths.},

Title = {Over-optimization of academic publishing metrics: observing Goodhart's
   Law in action},
Journal = {GIGASCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background The academic publishing world is changing significantly, with
   ever-growing numbers of publications each year and shifting publishing
   patterns. However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as
   the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not
   changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these
   metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart's Law, according to
   which, ``when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
   measure.{''} Results In this study, we analyzed > 120 million papers to
   examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last
   century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our
   study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being
   compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number
   of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer
   author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers.
   Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise
   affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference
   lists. Measures such as a journal's impact factor have also ceased to be
   good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in
   top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by
   analyzing properties of > 2,600 research fields, we observed that
   citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in
   different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic
   publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we
   measure success.},

Abstract = {Scientific knowledge constitutes a complex system that has recently been
   the topic of in-depth analysis. Empirical evidence reveals that little
   is known about the dynamic aspects of human knowledge. Precise
   dissection of the expansion of scientific knowledge could help us to
   better understand the evolutionary dynamics of science. In this paper,
   we analyzed the dynamic properties and growth principles of the MEDLINE
   bibliographic database using network analysis methodology. The basic
   assumption of this work is that the scientific evolution of the life
   sciences can be represented as a list of co-occurrences of MeSH
   descriptors that are linked to MEDLINE citations. The MEDLINE database
   was summarized as a complex system, consisting of nodes and edges, where
   the nodes refer to knowledge concepts and the edges symbolize
   corresponding relations. We performed an extensive statistical
   evaluation based on more than 25 million citations in the MEDLINE
   database, from 1966 until 2014. We based our analysis on node and
   community level in order to track temporal evolution in the network. The
   degree distribution of the network follows a stretched exponential
   distribution which prevents the creation of large hubs. Results showed
   that the appearance of new MeSH terms does not also imply new
   connections. The majority of new connections among nodes results from
   old MeSH descriptors. We suggest a wiring mechanism based on the theory
   of structural holes, according to which a novel scientific discovery is
   established when a connection is built among two or more previously
   disconnected parts of scientific knowledge. Overall, we extracted 142
   different evolving communities. It is evident that new communities are
   constantly born, live for some time, and then die. We also provide a
   Web-based application that helps characterize and understand the content
   of extracted communities. This study clearly shows that the evolution of
   MEDLINE knowledge correlates with the network's structural and temporal
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Scientific awards play incentive roles in advancing scientists' future
   career development, however, it is not clear how winning a scientific
   prize influences a scientist's future career persistence and performance
   across different disciplines and different career stages. To this end,
   we curated a representative dataset covering 1466 prizewinning
   scientists from 35 prestigious scientific prizes in seven disciplines.
   To investigate the potential benefits of one's academic career following
   the receipt of a prize, we matched each prizewinner with contenders to
   make sure that the winner and the contenders have comparable academic
   performance before prizewinning. Then the future performance of
   prizewinners and contenders in the same group are compared on three
   dimensions - productivity, scientific impact, and career persistence.
   Our findings suggest that after winning a prestigious prize, scientists
   generally publish more papers and receive more citations compared to
   their contenders. As for persistence, the Kaplan-Meier estimates on
   career length after the prizewinning show that scientists tend to
   maintain a longer active research career if their scientific merit are
   recognized via prizewinning. In addition, when dividing the prizewinners
   into three subgroups which are young, middle-aged, and senior
   prizewinners, we found that scientists tend to maintain a longer active
   career if they win prizes at the young or middle-aged career stage,
   while the difference is not significant between senior prizewinners and
   their contenders. Finally, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards
   model and found that the hazards of ending the academic career for young
   and middle-aged prizewinners are 59.5\% and 31.1\% lower than their
   contenders, respectively. This work highlights the importance of
   scientific merit recognition for scientists at their earlier career
   stage and provides strong implications for scientists' career
   development.},

Abstract = {The policy debate around researchers' geographic mobility has been
   moving away from a theorized zero-sum game in which countries can be
   winners ({''}brain gain{''}) or losers ({''}brain drain{''}), and toward
   the concept of ``brain circulation,{''} which implies that researchers
   move in and out of countries and everyone benefits. Quantifying trends
   in researchers' movements is key to understanding the drivers of the
   mobility of talent, as well as the implications of these patterns for
   the global system of science, and for the competitive advantages of
   individual countries. Existing studies have investigated bilateral flows
   of researchers. However, in order to understand migration systems,
   determining the extent to which researchers have worked in more than two
   countries is essential. This study focuses on the subgroup of highly
   mobile researchers whom we refer to as ``peripatetic researchers{''} or
   ``super-movers.{''}
   More specifically, our aim is to track the international movements of
   researchers who have published in more than two countries through
   changes in the main affiliation addresses of over 62 million
   publications indexed in theWeb of Science database over the 1956-2016
   period. Using this approach, we have established a longitudinal dataset
   on the international movements of highly mobile researchers across all
   subject categories, and in all disciplines of scholarship. This article
   contributes to the literature by offering for the first time a snapshot
   of the key features of highly mobile researchers, including their
   patterns of migration and return migration by academic age, the relative
   frequency of their disciplines, and the relative frequency of their
   countries of origin and destination. Among other findings, the results
   point to the emergence of a global system that includes the USA and
   China as two large hubs, and England and Germany as two smaller hubs for
   highly mobile researchers.},

Abstract = {Background
   Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) is a landmark imaging
   and omics study in AD. ADNI research literature has increased
   substantially over the past decade, which poses challenges for
   effectively communicating information about the results and impact of
   ADNI-related studies. In this work, we employed advanced information
   visualization techniques to perform a comprehensive and systematic
   mapping of the ADNI scientific growth and impact over a period of 12
   years.
   Methods
   Citation information of ADNI-related publications from 01/01/2003 to
   05/12/2015 were downloaded from the Scopus database. Five fields,
   including authors, years, affiliations, sources (journals), and
   keywords, were extracted and preprocessed. Statistical analyses were
   performed on basic publication data as well as journal and citations
   information. Science mapping workflows were conducted using the Science
   of Science (Sci2) Tool to generate geospatial, topical, and
   collaboration visualizations at the micro (individual) to macro (global)
   levels such as geospatial layouts of institutional collaboration
   networks, keyword co-occurrence networks, and author collaboration
   networks evolving overtime.
   Results
   During the studied period, 996 ADNI manuscripts were published across
   233 journals and conference proceedings. The number of publications grew
   linearly from 2008 to 2015, so did the number of involved institutions.
   ADNI publications received much more citations than typical papers from
   the same set of journals. Collaborations were visualized at multiple
   levels, including authors, institutions, and research areas. The
   evolution of key ADNI research topics was also plotted over the studied
   period.
   Conclusions
   Both statistical and visualization results demonstrate the increasing
   attention of ADNI research, strong citation impact of ADNI publications,
   the expanding collaboration networks among researchers, institutions and
   ADNI core areas, and the dynamic evolution of ADNI research topics. The
   visualizations presented here can help improve daily decision making
   based on a deep understanding of existing patterns and trends using
   proven and replicable data analysis and visualization methods. They have
   great potential to provide new insights and actionable knowledge for
   helping translational research in AD.},

Abstract = {The Journal of Business and Psychology (JBP) is dedicated to publishing
   high-quality and impactful research with the ultimate goals of advancing
   our science of work and organizations (Rogelberg 2009). To promote this
   end, we examined three years of JBP author, manuscript, and reviewer
   data in the hopes of gleaning insights into potential drivers of
   manuscript quality and publication success for authorship teams.
   Although the great majority of research in the organizational sciences
   is conducted in teams (Acedo et al. 2006; Wuchty et al. 2007), an
   extensive literature review revealed scant empirical work investigating
   team factors related to manuscript quality. This opportunity prompted a
   collaborative effort between the Journal of Business and Psychology and
   the Journal of Management to conduct a parallel study of author team
   composition, decisions, activities, and manuscript quality. The goal of
   this collaboration is to start a multi-faceted conversation around
   potential avenues for current and future authors to promote scholarly
   impact in their research. This paper focuses on small
   research/authorship teams, comprised of two, three, or four members, who
   have submitted papers to Journal of Business and Psychology. We examine
   a number of team factors, such as team composition and experiential
   resources, team communication, and team publication-related development
   activities prior to submitting the paper for publication. For each of
   these areas, we assess how they relate to both overall reviewer ratings
   of quality and editor decisions. Using a reflective inductive approach,
   we highlight and discuss the most interesting findings. Finally, after
   discussing our limitations, we offer suggestions for future research
   directions around the domain of the science of organizational
   scholarship with the goal of encouraging such submissions to the Journal
   of Business and Psychology.},

Title = {On the social shaping dimensions of smart sustainable cities: A study in
   science, technology, and society},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {219-246},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Situated within science of science, this study analyzes the nature,
   practice, and impact of ICT of the new wave of computing for urban
   sustainability as a form of science and technology (S\&T) within the
   defining context of smart sustainable cities. Specifically, it probes
   the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why
   it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and
   policyurban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to
   environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these
   aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which
   supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a
   variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows
   that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially
   produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially
   anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new
   wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are
   medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically
   advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge
   and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape,
   sociocultural and politicoinstitutional structures. In addition, the
   study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable
   cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation,
   productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying
   ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its
   association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments.
   This form of S\&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental
   sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more
   environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently
   practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda
   of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.

Abstract = {Science is becoming increasingly more interdisciplinary, giving rise to
   more diversity in the areas of expertise, In such a complex environment,
   the participation of authors became more specialized, hampering the task
   of evaluating authors according to their contributions. While some
   metrics were adapted to account for the order (or rank) of authors in a
   paper, many journals are now requiring a description of their specific
   roles in the publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the
   relationships between credited contributions and author's rank has been
   limited to a few studies. Here we analyzed such a kind of data and show,
   quantitatively, that the regularity in the authorship contributions
   decreases with the number of authors in a paper. Furthermore, we found
   that the rank of authors and their roles in papers follow three general
   patterns according to the nature of their contributions: (i) the total
   contribution increases with author's rank; (ii) the total contribution
   decreases with author's rank; and (iii) the total contribution is
   symmetric, with most of contributions being performed by first and last
   authors. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data
   retrieved from PLoS One and by devising a measurement of the effective
   number of authors in a paper. The analysis of such patterns confirms
   that some aspects of the author ranking are in accordance with the
   expected convention, such as the first and last authors being more
   likely to contribute more diversely in a scientific work. Conversely,
   such analysis also revealed that authors in the intermediary positions
   of the rank contribute more in specific roles, such as collecting data.
   This indicates that the an unbiased evaluation of researchers must take
   into account the distinct types of scientific contributions. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The paper explores possible influences that some developments in the
   field of branches of AI, called automated discovery and machine learning
   systems, might have upon some aspects of the old debate between Francis
   Bacon's inductivism and Karl Popper's falsificationism. Donald Gillies
   facetiously calls this controversy the duel of two English knights', and
   claims, after some analysis of historical cases of discovery, that
   Baconian induction had been used in science very rarely, or not at all,
   although he argues that the situation has changed with the advent of
   machine learning systems. (Some clarification of terms machine learning
   and automated discovery is required here. The key idea of machine
   learning is that, given data with associated outcomes, software can be
   trained to make those associations in future cases which typically
   amounts to inducing some rules from individual cases classified by the
   experts. Automated discovery (also called machine discovery) deals with
   uncovering new knowledge that is valuable for human beings, and its key
   idea is that discovery is like other intellectual tasks and that the
   general idea of heuristic search in problem spaces applies also to
   discovery tasks. However, since machine learning systems discover (very
   low-level) regularities in data, throughout this paper I use the generic
   term automated discovery for both kinds of systems. I will elaborate on
   this later on). Gillies's line of argument can be generalised: thanks to
   automated discovery systems, philosophers of science have at their
   disposal a new tool for empirically testing their philosophical
   hypotheses. Accordingly, in the paper, I will address the question,
   which of the two philosophical conceptions of scientific method is
   better vindicated in view of the successes and failures of systems
   developed within three major research programmes in the field: machine
   learning systems in the Turing tradition, normative theory of scientific
   discovery formulated by Herbert Simon's group and the programme called
   HHNT, proposed by J. Holland, K. Holyoak, R. Nisbett and P. Thagard.},

Title = {The academic wanderer: structure of collaboration network and relation
   with research performance},
Journal = {APPLIED NETWORK SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {Thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale datasets on
   scholarly outputs, science itself has come under the microscope with the
   aim of capturing a quantitative understanding of its workings. In this
   study, we leverage well-established cognitive models coming from
   anthropology in order to characterise the personal network of
   collaborations between scientists, i.e., the network considered from the
   standpoint of each individual researcher (referred to as ego network),
   in terms of the cognitive investment they devote to the different
   collaborations. Building upon these models, we study the interplay
   between the structure of academic collaborations, academic performance,
   and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into account
   both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes)
   and geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different
   countries). For our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the
   geo-referenced publications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from
   Scopus, one of the biggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main
   finding is that there is a clear correlation between the structure of
   co-authorship ego networks and academic performance indices: the more
   one publishes and the higher their impact, the larger their
   collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity bound effect,
   whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become increasingly
   less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find that
   international academic migrants are better at growing their networks
   than researchers that only migrate within the same country, but the
   latter seem to be better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve
   higher impact. High academic mobility does not appear to translate into
   better academic performance or larger collaboration networks. This shows
   a different finding with respect to related literature, where scientific
   productivity is seen as directly linked to mobility. Our results show
   that, when looking at impact of research, this is not necessarily the
   case.},

Title = {Research Advances in Molecular Modeling in Cyclodextrins},
Journal = {CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {522-531},
Abstract = {Background: Cyclodextrins (CDs), as one type of the novel pharmaceutical
   excipients, have been widely used in drug delivery and pharmaceutical
   industry. Over the past decades, a large amount of molecular modeling
   studies in CDs were reported for profound understanding of structural,
   dynamic and energetic features of CDs systems. Thus, this review is
   focused on qualitative and quantitative analysis of research outputs on
   molecular modeling in CDs.
   Methods: The original data were collected from Web of Science and
   analyzed by scientific knowledge mapping tools, including Citespace,
   Science of Science, VOSviewer, GPSvisualizer and Gephi software.
   Scientific knowledge mapping, as an emerging approach for literature
   analysis, was employed to identify the knowledge structure and capture
   the development of the science in a visual way.
   Results: The results of analysis included research outputs landscape,
   collaboration patterns, knowledge structure and research frontiers shift
   with time. China had the largest contributions to the publication number
   in this area, while USA dominated the high quality research outputs.
   International collaboration between USA and Europe was much stronger
   than that within Asia. J American Chemical Society, as one of the most
   important journals, played a pivotal role in linking different research
   fields. Furthermore, seven important thematic clusters were identified
   by the research cluster analysis with visualization tools and
   demonstrated from three different perspectives including: (1) the
   mostly-used CD molecules: beta-Cyclodextrin, (2) preferred modeling
   tools: docking calculation and molecular dynamic, (3) hot research
   fields: structural properties, solubility, chiral recognition and
   solidstate inclusion complexes. Moreover, research frontier shift in the
   past three decades was traced by detecting keywords bursts with high
   citation.
   Conclusion: The current review provided us a macro-perspective and
   intellectual landscape to molecular modeling in CDs.},

Title = {Using network analyses to examine the extent to which and in what ways
   psychology is multidisciplinary},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {The emerging field known as the ``science of science{''} uses a variety
   of quantitative techniques to (among other things) understand how a
   specific field changes over time. The tools of network science were used
   to quantify the extent to which Psychology is multidisciplinary, and how
   the extent to which it is multidisciplinary changed over time. Citation
   networks were created from all of the articles published in journals
   identified by the Web of Science as Multidisciplinary-Psychology for
   each year from 2008 to 2018. Nodes in the networks represented
   Multidisciplinary-Psychology journals, and connections were placed to
   other journals (i.e., nodes) that were cited in the
   Multidisciplinary-Psychology articles for each year. The citation
   networks showed that about 25\% of the citations were to other
   Multidisciplinary-Psychology journals, about 50\% of the citations were
   to Psychology journals in other sub-fields, and about 25\% of the
   citations were to journals in other disciplines. This distribution of
   citations remained fairly consistent across the years examined. To
   identify the ways in which Psychology is multidisciplinary, clusters of
   nodes (known as modules) in each citation network were detected to
   identify possible research themes that were examined further with
   co-word networks made from the author-provided keywords in each of the
   Multidisciplinary-Psychology articles that appeared in each Module. Some
   research topics persisted in the years examined, whereas other topics
   were more transient. Given that multidisciplinary research did not
   increase over time but instead changed in areas of research focus, ways
   for academic and research administrators to foster and continually renew
   multidisciplinary research are discussed. The discussion also describes
   how individual researchers might use the techniques here to identify
   areas of research that are less commonly explored and may prove to be
   fruitful areas to shift their research focus. The same techniques can be
   used to provide insight in to other disciplines in the Humanities and
   Social Sciences.},

Title = {Tapping into science advisers' learning},
Journal = {PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {The art and craft of science advice is not innately known by those
   scientists who choose to step out of the lab or the university to engage
   with the world of policy. Despite a wealth of literature on the `science
   of science advice', in nearly every situation there is no `teacher' of
   science advice; it is a typical case of learning on the job. Within that
   context, the learning of scholars engaging in expert advice is always
   situated and can sometimes be transformative. To date, however, there
   has been no systematic, in-depth research into expert advisers'
   learning-instead focusing mostly on policymakers' and publics' learning
   about science. In this article, I suggest that such a research programme
   is timely and potentially a very fruitful line of inquiry for two mains
   reasons. First, in the case of environmental and climate issues-the
   focus of the paper-it has become ubiquitous to talk about the need for
   transformative change(s) towards sustainable futures. If scholars are
   going to advocate for and inform transformations beyond academia, then
   in doing so they ought to also take a harder look at how they themselves
   are transforming within. Specifically, the article illustrates how
   qualitative research on advisers' learning can contribute to our
   understanding of how experts are adapting to changing circumstances in
   science-policy interactions. Second, it is argued that research on
   advisers' learning can directly contribute to: (i) guidance for present
   and future advisers (especially early-career researchers wishing to
   engage with policy) and organisational learning in science-policy
   organisations; and (ii) improving policy-relevance of research and the
   design of impact evaluations for research funding (e.g. Research
   Excellence Framework). With the hope of stimulating (rather than closing
   off) innovative ideas, the article offers some ways of thinking through
   and carrying out such a research programme. As the nature of both
   science and policymaking continues to change, the learning experiences
   of expert advisers is a bountiful resource that has yet to be tapped
   into.},

Abstract = {Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output
   of scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of
   scientific impact is citations, with a growing body of literature
   focused on predicting the number of citations obtained by any given
   publication. The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is
   fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations,
   whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and
   publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this
   limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by
   many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely:
   ``Will this paper increase my h-index?{''} Using a real academic dataset
   with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation
   relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we
   formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine
   several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary author's
   h-index. We find that the researcher's authority on the publication
   topic and the venue in which the paper is published are crucial factors
   to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the topic
   popularity and the co-authors' hindices are of surprisingly little
   relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5\%
   potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an
   author's h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate
   a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76\%
   probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with
   the highest current h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings
   on the quantification of scientific impact can help researchers to
   expand their influence and more effectively leverage their position of
   ``standing on the shoulders of giants.{''}},

Title = {Scientific rewards for biomedical specialization are large and
   persistent},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Background While specialization plays an essential role in how
   scientific research is pursued, we understand little about its effects
   on a researcher's impact and career. In particular, the extent to which
   one specializes within their chosen fields likely has complex
   relationships with productivity, career stage, and eventual impact.
   Here, we develop a novel and fine-grained approach for measuring a
   researcher's level of specialization at each point in their career and
   apply it to the publication data of almost 30,000 established biomedical
   researchers to measure the effect that specialization has on the impact
   of a researcher's publications. Results Using a within-researcher,
   panel-based econometric framework, we arrive at several important
   results. First, there are significant scientific rewards for
   specialization-25\% more citations per standard deviation increase in
   specialization. Second, these benefits are much higher early in a
   researcher's career-as large as 75\% per standard deviation increase in
   specialization. Third, rewards are higher for researchers who publish
   few papers relative to their peers. Finally, we find that, all else
   equal, researchers who make large changes in their research direction
   see generally increased impact. Conclusions The extent to which one
   specializes, particularly at the early stages of a biomedical research
   career, appears to play a significant role in determining the
   citation-based impact of their publications. When this measure of impact
   is, implicitly or explicitly, an input into decision-making processes
   within the scientific system (for example, for job opportunities,
   promotions, or invited talks), these findings lead to some important
   implications for the system-level organization of scientific research
   and the incentives that exist therein. We propose several mechanisms
   within modern scientific systems that likely lead to the scientific
   rewards we observe and discuss them within the broader context of reward
   structures in biomedicine and science more generally.},

Abstract = {This article, for which the focus is an intellectual autobiography,
   examines the development of worldview of a young person who graduated
   from the Moscow University Faculty of Philosophy in 1970. It highlights
   the main socially significant events of those times, events that
   determined the formation of the sociopolitical views of youth who did
   not accept Soviet ideology. It presents the reading circles and
   interactions of that period and tells of the outstanding Russian
   philosophers of the 1960s-1970s under whose influence this professional
   development took place. It considers the main topics of the key
   scholarship in philosophy, as well as the dynamics of research interests
   and problems. Particular attention is paid to the story of the
   originality of work by the Moscow Methodological Circle, led by Georgy
   P. Shchedrovitsky. The circle's main task was to put all acts of
   reasoning and mental operations-naming, defining, describing, building
   ontological models and theoretical constructions, and so forth-under
   reflexive control. This was, to some extent, reminiscent of the
   inquiries of Western analytical philosophy, which made it a
   ``suspicious{''} activity in the ideological sense in the Soviet Union.
   Cognition as a whole no longer seemed a ``reflection{''} of reality, as
   had been proclaimed in the leading epistemological understanding of
   Marxist-Leninist philosophy. However, this also reflected the desire of
   intellectuals of the sixties and seventies to rationalize all social
   life as a whole. These dreams of ``rationality{''} manifested at the
   time in the development of relevant topics in disciplines such as
   epistemology, in philosophy and methodology of science, and in
   sociological and psychological research. The author tells how the
   discussions of methodological problems of historical reconstruction
   began from positions like these. The discussion of discourse on
   knowledge in the humanities required not only intellectual audacity but
   social audacity as well. These discussions took place in informal,
   home-based seminars and represented a marginal, ``clandestine{''}
   phenomenon.},

Abstract = {We study international mobility in academia, with a focus on the
   migration of published researchers to and from Russia. Using an
   exhaustive set of over 2.4 million Scopus publications, we analyze all
   researchers who have published with a Russian affiliation address in
   Scopus-indexed sources in 1996-2020. The migration of researchers is
   observed through the changes in their affiliation addresses, which
   altered their mode countries of affiliation across different years.
   While only 5.2\% of these researchers were internationally mobile, they
   accounted for a substantial proportion of citations. Our estimates of
   net migration rates indicate that while Russia was a donor country in
   the late 1990s and early 2000s, it has experienced a relatively balanced
   circulation of researchers in more recent years. These findings suggest
   that the current trends in scholarly migration in Russia could be better
   framed as brain circulation, rather than as brain drain. Overall,
   researchers emigrating from Russia outnumbered and outperformed
   researchers immigrating to Russia. Our analysis on the subject
   categories of publication venues shows that in the past 25 years, Russia
   has, overall, suffered a net loss in most disciplines, and most notably
   in the five disciplines of neuroscience, decision sciences, mathematics,
   biochemistry, and pharmacology. We demonstrate the robustness of our
   main findings under random exclusion of data and changes in numeric
   parameters. Our substantive results shed light on new aspects of
   international mobility in academia, and on the impact of this mobility
   on a national science system, which have direct implications for policy
   development. Methodologically, our novel approach to handling big data
   can be adopted as a framework of analysis for studying scholarly
   migration in other countries.},

Abstract = {Academia is a competitive world where researchers are judged by their
   productivity, and their strategies to get visibility and success (i.e.,
   number of citations) vary. In addition to conducting rigorous research,
   there are social strategies that influence authors' and their papers'
   level of citations. The author's position in the co-authorship network
   affects the success of their papers. Hence, we want to understand if the
   authors' segregation in the co-authorship network relates to citations
   gained by a paper over time. We address this question by examining the
   patterns in Computer Science from 1975 to 2015 (and citations until
   2020) from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. Specifically, we
   identify communities in the co-authorship network and classify them into
   segregation categories and core positions. Then, we compare the citation
   histories of papers written in those communities. We examine papers
   written solely by members of the same community (internal) and different
   communities (external), resulting in the following five categories:
   internal highly-segregated, internal non-segregated, external
   highly-segregated, external non-segregated, and external mixed. Our
   results show that from 1998 to 2010, internal highly-segregated papers
   gained fewer citations than internal non-segregated and external mixed
   papers. Also, from 2010 to 2015, external mixed papers gained more
   citations than internal non-segregated papers and even more citations
   than internal highly-segregated papers. We also found that in the
   network nucleus (from core decomposition), there is little difference in
   the citations of internal non- and highly-segregated papers. In
   contrast, in the network's periphery, internal non-segregated papers
   tend to gain more citations than internal highly-segregated papers since
   2005. From this work, we conclude that papers written by a more diverse
   set of authors (measured by their network connectivity) receive more
   citations over time and that to compensate for the lack of diversity,
   their authors should be in central positions of the co-authorship
   network. Hence, this work could incentivise diverse co-authorships and
   strengthen researchers' cohesion to increase their papers' success.},

Abstract = {The understanding of how science works can contribute to making
   scientific development more effective. In this paper, we report an
   analysis of the organization and the interconnection between unbalanced
   areas of study. More specifically, we considered two important subareas
   in analytical chemistry, namely capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass
   spectrometry (MS). These areas are particularly interesting because MS
   is employed in a bigger range of applications than CE. Consequently,
   these different portions of papers can interfere in the quality of the
   searches for papers devoted to CE-MS. Here, we considered a citation
   network in which the nodes and connections represent papers and
   citations, respectively. The network clusters were detected by employing
   the Infomap algorithm. By considering the clusters and the respective
   abstracts, the subjects were identified. Interesting results were found,
   including a marked separation between some clusters of articles devoted
   to instrumentation techniques and applications, which was quantified
   from the abstract contents. For instance, the most well-defined
   community was assigned as CE (Instru.), with 73.8\% of the papers having
   abstracts that include the word ``electrophoresis{''} and not the word
   ``mass{''}. However, the papers that describe CE-MS did not lead to a
   well-defined cluster. In order to better understand the organization of
   the citation network, we considered a multi-scale analysis, in which we
   used the information regarding sub-clusters. Firstly, we analyzed the
   sub-cluster that contains the first article devoted to the coupling
   between CE and MS, whose subject was found to be a good representation
   of its sub-cluster. The second analysis was about the sub-cluster of a
   seminal paper known to be the first that dealt with protein analysis by
   using CE-MS and a similar result was obtained. By considering the
   proposed methodologies, our paper can contribute to researchers working
   with similar scenarios, since it shows that a given subject can be
   spread on many clusters of the network, therefore, lead to better
   literature reviews.},

Title = {How do organisations implement research impact assessment (RIA)
   principles and good practice? A narrative review and exploratory study
   of four international research funding and administrative organisations},
Journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Background Public research funding agencies and research organisations
   are increasingly accountable for the wider impacts of the research they
   support. While research impact assessment (RIA) frameworks and tools
   exist, little is known and shared of how these organisations implement
   RIA activities in practice. Methods We conducted a review of academic
   literature to search for research organisations' published experiences
   of RIAs. We followed this with semi-structured interviews from a
   convenience sample (n = 7) of representatives of four research
   organisations deploying strategies to support and assess research
   impact. Results We found only five studies reporting empirical evidence
   on how research organisations put RIA principles into practice. From our
   interviews, we observed a disconnect between published RIA frameworks
   and tools, and the realities of organisational practices, which tended
   not to be reported. We observed varying maturity and readiness with
   respect to organisations' structural set ups for conducting RIAs,
   particularly relating to leadership, skills for evaluation and
   automating RIA data collection. Key processes for RIA included efforts
   to engage researcher communities to articulate and plan for impact,
   using a diversity of methods, frameworks and indicators, and supporting
   a learning approach. We observed outcomes of RIAs as having supported a
   dialogue to orient research to impact, underpinned shared learning from
   analyses of research, and provided evidence of the value of research in
   different domains and to different audiences. Conclusions Putting RIA
   principles and frameworks into practice is still in early stages for
   research organisations. We recommend that organisations (1) get set up
   by considering upfront the resources, time and leadership required to
   embed impact strategies throughout the organisation and wider research
   `ecosystem', and develop methodical approaches to assessing impact; (2)
   work together by engaging researcher communities and wider stakeholders
   as a core part of impact pathway planning and subsequent assessment; and
   (3) recognise the benefits that RIA can bring about as a means to
   improve mutual understanding of the research process between different
   actors with an interest in research.},

   understand their scale-dependent behavior. For a journal of n randomly
   selected papers from a population of all papers, we expect from the
   Theorem that its IF fluctuates around the population average mu, and
   spans a range of values proportional to sigma / root n, where sigma(2)
   is the variance of the population's citation distribution. The 1 / root
   n dependence has profound implications for IF rankings: The larger a
   journal, the narrower the range around mu where its IF lies. IF rankings
   therefore allocate an unfair advantage to smaller journals in the high
   IF ranks, and to larger journals in the low IF ranks. As a result, we
   expect a scale-dependent stratification of journals in IF rankings,
   whereby small journals occupy the top, middle, and bottom ranks;
   mid-sized journals occupy the middle ranks; and very large journals have
   IFs that asymptotically approach mu. We obtain qualitative and
   quantitative confirmation of these predictions by analyzing (i) the
   complete set of 166,498 IF \& journal-size data pairs in the 1997-2016
   Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, (ii) the top-cited
   portion of 276,000 physics papers published in 2014-2015, and (iii) the
   citation distributions of an arbitrarily sampled list of physics
   journals. We conclude that the Central Limit Theorem is a good predictor
   of the IF range of actual journals, while sustained deviations from its
   predictions are a mark of true, non-random, citation impact. IF rankings
   are thus misleading unless one compares like-sized journals or adjusts
   for these effects. We propose the Phi index, a rescaled IF that accounts
   for size effects, and which can be readily generalized to account also
   for different citation practices across research fields. Our methodology
   applies to other citation averages that are used to compare research
   fields, university departments or countries in various types of
   rankings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Inequality and cumulative advantage in science careers: a case study of
   high-impact journals},
Journal = {EPJ DATA SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Analyzing a large data set of publications drawn from the most
   competitive journals in the natural and social sciences we show that
   research careers exhibit the broad distributions of individual
   achievement characteristic of systems in which cumulative advantage
   plays a key role. While most researchers are personally aware of the
   competition implicit in the publication process, little is known about
   the levels of inequality at the level of individual researchers. Here we
   analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set of
   researchers publishing in high-impact journals, accounting for censoring
   biases in the publication data by using distinct researcher cohorts
   defined over non-overlapping time periods. For each researcher cohort we
   calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values around
   0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For
   perspective, these observed values are well in excess of the inequality
   levels observed for personal income in developing countries.
   Investigating possible sources of this inequality, we identify two
   potential mechanisms that act at the level of the individual that may
   play defining roles in the emergence of the broad productivity and
   impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the average
   time interval between a researcher's successive publications in top
   journals decreases with each subsequent publication. Second, after
   controlling for the time dependent features of citation distributions,
   we compare the citation impact of subsequent publications within a
   researcher's publication record. We find that as researchers continue to
   publish in top journals, there is more likely to be a decreasing trend
   in the relative citation impact with each subsequent publication. This
   pattern highlights the difficulty of repeatedly producing research
   findings in the highest citation-impact echelon, as well as the role
   played by finite career and knowledge life-cycles, and the intriguing
   possibility that confirmation bias plays a role in the evaluation of
   scientific careers.},

Title = {Trends in knowledge management research in small businesses},
Journal = {EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 23},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to map the knowledge management research in
   small businesses and suggest future actions to strengthen managerial
   practices. Knowledge management practices foster the growth of small
   businesses. They allow innovation to grow within the institutions,
   enhance customer satisfaction and reduce employee absenteeism and
   attrition.Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a bibliometric
   protocol to retrieve the 686 articles published in the Web of Science
   (WoS) database. The WoS database is selected to ensure only quality and
   peer reviewed publications are analysed in the study. It then identifies
   the top contributions, and existing thematic areas, and suggests future
   research and policy actions for boosting economic growth through small
   business. The study uses VOSviewer, Science of Science (Sci2) and Gephi
   to conduct the bibliometric and network analysis.Findings - The results
   from keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analysis helps in identifying
   thematic areas. The findings highlight that there exist five major
   themes in knowledge management research for small businesses. The
   dynamic co-citation analysis helps in tracing the evolution of these
   clusters and suggests future themes, research directions and
   methodological advances in the theme. PageRank analysis helps in
   identifying the top articles published on high-impact journals in the
   theme.Research limitations/implications - The study helps researchers by
   summarising existing literature and identifying key thematic areas. It
   also assists policymakers by recommending actions to improve knowledge
   management practises in small businesses to gain a competitive
   advantage. The paper suffers from the limitations of bibliometric
   analysis. The sample is collected from a single data source and a single
   type (journal articles) and the statistical accuracy of the analysis
   depends on the quality of the sample. Originality/value - The study's
   originality lies in using fit-for-purpose software in clustering the
   research and suggesting actions. To the best of the authors' knowledge,
   this study is one of its kind in applying bibliometrics in studying and
   covering several aspects of knowledge management in small businesses
   with a combination of software.},

Title = {Pedagogy in the Constellation of Sciences: Methodological Dialogue and
   ``Knowledge Transfer ``},
Journal = {VOPROSY FILOSOFII},
Year = {2022},
Number = {6},
Pages = {75-86},
Abstract = {According to representatives of the exact sciences, as well as
   philosophers and methodologists of the humanities, the epistemological
   status of pedagogy today is quite low. There are no verified regulations
   for the empirical, theoretical and contextual substantiation of
   conclusions and methods for obtaining them; the voices of the
   theoreticians of pedagogical science about the structure and component
   composition of pedagogical theory sound polyphonic. The differences
   between theory and concept, long recognized in the science of science,
   do not find the right understanding and response in pedagogical works.
   Pedagogy, being an integral member of the community of human sciences,
   must today enter into an active and meaningful scientific dialogue with
   methodologists, science scholars, humanists, who represent a
   ``strong{''} version of human knowledge. De-scribed by the famous
   Russian philosopher L.A. Mikeshina's methodological dia-logues prompted
   us to take up the urgently required concretization of the author's
   interesting conclusions and arguments in relation to the methodology of
   pedagogy which L.A. Mikeshina presents as transfer of terms
   (extrapolation). Based on the analysis of the cited book and many works
   of philosophers and teachers, we man-aged to build a triad of criteria
   for correct extrapolation of terms: a) address cor-rectness;
   correspondence of the pedagogical sound of the term transferred to
   ped-agogy to that which is accepted in donor science; b) the creative
   focus of the transferred term; c) detachment from repetition of the
   well-known method of noise stylistic reproduction. As one of the
   examples of the transfer of knowledge into pedagogy, the author
   considers the absorption by the science of education of the stylistics
   of related sciences based on scientific metaphors. The second part of
   the article is devoted to the theoretical construction of pedagogy. A
   methodologi-cal screen of a particular pedagogical theory is presented,
   white spots of the topic are revealed, the idea of theoretical
   constructions in pedagogy, reflected qualita-tively and quantitatively,
   is proposed. The connection between the problem of knowledge transfer
   (1) and the theoretical construction of pedagogy (2) is shown.},

   Network-on-Chip Research From a Complex Network Perspective},

Abstract = {The academia and industry have been pursuing network-on-chip (NoC)
   related research since two decades ago when there was an urgency to
   respond to the scaling and technological challenges imposed on
   intra-chip communication in SoC designs. Like any other research topic,
   NoC inevitably goes through its life cycle: A. it started up (2000-2007)
   and quickly gained traction in its own right; B. it then entered the
   phase of growth and shakeout (2008-2013) with the research outcomes
   peaked in 2010 and remained high for another four/five years; C. NoC
   research was considered mature and stable (2014-2020), with signs
   showing a steady slowdown. Although from time to time, excellent survey
   articles on different subjects/aspects of NoC appeared in the open
   literature, yet there is no general consensus on where we are in this
   NoC roadmap and where we are heading, largely due to lack of an
   overarching methodology and tool to assess and quantify the research
   outcomes and evolution. In this paper, we address this issue from the
   perspective of three specific complex networks, namely the citation
   network, the subject citation network, and the co-authorship network.
   The network structure parameters (e.g., modularity, diameter, etc.) and
   graph dynamics of the three networks are extracted and analyzed, which
   helps reveal and explain the reasons and the driving forces behind all
   the changes observed in NoC research over 20 years. Additional analyses
   are performed in this study to link interesting phenomena surrounding
   the NoC area. They include: (1) relationships between communities in
   citation networks and NoC subjects, (2) measure and visualization of a
   subject's influence score and its evolution, (3) knowledge flow among
   the six most popular NoC subjects and their relationships, (4) evolution
   of various subjects in terms of number of publications, (5)
   collaboration patterns and cross-community collaboration among the
   authors in NoC research, (6) interesting observation of career lifetime
   and productivity among NoC researchers, and finally (7) investigation of
   whether or not new authors are chasing hot subjects in NoC. All these
   analyses have led to a prediction of publications, subjects, and
   co-authorship in NoC research in the near future, which is also
   presented in the paper.},

Title = {ISRIA statement: ten-point guidelines for an effective process of
   research impact assessment},
Journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {As governments, funding agencies and research organisations worldwide
   seek to maximise both the financial and non-financial returns on
   investment in research, the way the research process is organised and
   funded is becoming increasingly under scrutiny. There are growing
   demands and aspirations to measure research impact (beyond academic
   publications), to understand how science works, and to optimise its
   societal and economic impact. In response, a multidisciplinary practice
   called research impact assessment is rapidly developing. Given that the
   practice is still in its formative stage, systematised recommendations
   or accepted standards for practitioners (such as funders and those
   responsible for managing research projects) across countries or
   disciplines to guide research impact assessment are not yet available.
   In this statement, we propose initial guidelines for a rigorous and
   effective process of research impact assessment applicable to all
   research disciplines and oriented towards practice. This statement
   systematises expert knowledge and practitioner experience from designing
   and delivering the International School on Research Impact Assessment
   (ISRIA). It brings together insights from over 450 experts and
   practitioners from 34 countries, who participated in the school during
   its 5-year run (from 2013 to 2017) and shares a set of core values from
   the school's learning programme. These insights are distilled into
   ten-point guidelines, which relate to (1) context, (2) purpose, (3)
   stakeholders' needs, (4) stakeholder engagement, (5) conceptual
   frameworks, (6) methods and data sources, (7) indicators and metrics,
   (8) ethics and conflicts of interest, (9) communication, and (10)
   community of practice. The guidelines can help practitioners improve and
   standardise the process of research impact assessment, but they are by
   no means exhaustive and require evaluation and continuous improvement.
   The prima facie effectiveness of the guidelines is based on the
   systematised expert and practitioner knowledge of the school's faculty
   and participants derived from their practical experience and research
   evidence. The current knowledge base has gaps in terms of the
   geographical and scientific discipline as well as stakeholder coverage
   and representation. The guidelines can be further strengthened through
   evaluation and continuous improvement by the global research impact
   assessment community.},

Abstract = {The post-war era of the 1940s is known for the birth of global
   governance, a time when Western nations united in efforts to reconstruct
   the war-torn world and reflected on the role of science in society.
   History and philosophy of science (HPS) was one of the early projects
   that emerged out of the war years. Diana (Ding) Dyason who headed the
   first HPS department in the southern hemisphere is honoured by this
   annual lecture, the text of which constitutes this article. Thomas
   Kuhn's influential lecture in Oxford in 1961 inspired her work on the
   history of scientific entanglement with social concerns, and the
   directions of HPS at the University of Melbourne. Post-war
   reconstruction was both a local and a national project for every nation,
   very much in the air in the 1940s, and influential until the 1970s. The
   Australasian Association of Scientific Workers (AASW) brought together
   scientists too old to serve, or, in reserved occupations, to undertake
   their own `war effort' on the question of: `What comes next?' AASW held
   a planning conference in Sydney in 1944 to `formulate a policy on the
   organisation of science necessary to meet the demands of post-war
   Australia'. They set out to consider the role of the `the scientific
   method' in the welfare of society. In particular, they recognised their
   existing international scientific networks and connections could become
   valuable for post-war collaborations between different sciences and
   different nations of benefit to Australia and the world. The idea of
   `the environment' was one of many that emerged internationally in these
   `world-minded' times, an idea that focused on the management of nature
   for the benefit of people using the scientific method. National Parks
   were a crucial discussion point, bringing together amateur naturalists
   and professional environmental managers of all sorts in discussions
   about landscape planning along with international comparative work on
   reserving places for wild animals and plants. This Dyason Lecture
   explores the emergence of `integrated science', of science in the
   service of society, that later included natural resource management, big
   science, environmental science, earth systems science and climate
   science. It begins with the tragedy of the `dirty thirties', when soil
   was in the air, and the scientific response to concerns about feeding
   the world.},

Title = {Establishing Institutional Scores With the Rigor and Transparency Index:
   Large-scale Analysis of Scientific Reporting Quality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Improving rigor and transparency measures should lead to
   improvements in reproducibility across the scientific literature;
   however, the assessment of measures of transparency tends to be very
   difficult if performed manually. Objective: This study addresses the
   enhancement of the Rigor and Transparency Index (RTI, version 2.0),
   which attempts to automatically assess the rigor and transparency of
   journals, institutions, and countries using manuscripts scored on
   criteria found in reproducibility guidelines (eg, Materials Design,
   Analysis, and Reporting checklist criteria).
   Methods: The RTI tracks 27 entity types using natural language
   processing techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory
   Conditional Random Field-based models and regular expressions; this
   allowed us to assess over 2 million papers accessed through PubMed
   Central.
   Results: Between 1997 and 2020 (where data were readily available in our
   data set), rigor and transparency measures showed general improvement
   (RTI 2.29 to 4.13), suggesting that authors are taking the need for
   improved reporting seriously. The top-scoring journals in 2020 were the
   Journal of Neurochemistry (6.23), British Journal of Pharmacology
   (6.07), and Nature Neuroscience (5.93). We extracted the institution and
   country of origin from the author affiliations to expand our analysis
   beyond journals. Among institutions publishing >1000 papers in 2020 (in
   the PubMed Central open access set), Capital Medical University (4.75),
   Yonsei University (4.58), and University of Copenhagen (4.53) were the
   top performers in terms of RTI. In country-level performance, we found
   that Ethiopia and Norway consistently topped the RTI charts of countries
   with 100 or more papers per year. In addition, we tested our assumption
   that the RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability
   (ie, a high RTI represents papers containing sufficient information for
   replication efforts). Using work by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer
   Biology, we determined that replication papers (RTI 7.61, SD 0.78)
   scored significantly higher (P<.001) than the original papers (RTI 3.39,
   SD 1.12), which according to the project required additional information
   from authors to begin replication efforts.
   Conclusions: These results align with our view that RTI may serve as a
   reliable proxy for scientific replicability. Unfortunately, RTI measures
   for journals, institutions, and countries fall short of the replicated
   paper average. If we consider the RTI of these replication studies as a
   target for future manuscripts, more work will be needed to ensure that
   the average manuscript contains sufficient information for replication
   attempts.},

Title = {The Social Shaping of the Metaverse as an Alternative to the Imaginaries
   of Data-Driven Smart Cities: A Study in Science, Technology, and Society},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Science and technology transform the frontiers of knowledge and have
   deep and powerful impacts on society, demonstrating how social reality
   varies with each era of the world. As a set of fictional representations
   of technologically driven future worlds, the Metaverse is increasingly
   shaping the socio-technical imaginaries of data-driven smart cities,
   i.e., the outcome of radical transformations of dominant structures,
   processes, practices, and cultures. At the core of the systematic
   exploration of science and technology is the relationships between
   scientific knowledge, technological systems, and values and ethics from
   a wide range of perspectives. Positioned within science of science, this
   study investigates the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form
   of science and technology and the wider social context in which it is
   embedded. Therefore, it adopts an analytical and philosophical framework
   of STS, and in doing so, it employs an integrated approach to discourse
   analysis, supported by a comparative analysis of the Metaverse and
   Ambient Intelligence. This study shows that the Metaverse as a
   scientific and technological activity is socially constructed,
   politically driven, economically conditioned, and historically situated.
   That is, it is inherently human and hence value-laden, as well as can
   only be understood as contextualized within the
   socio-political-economic-historical framework that gives rise to it,
   sustains it, and makes it durable by material effects and networks. This
   view in turn corroborates that the Metaverse raises serious concerns as
   to determinism, social exclusion, marginalization, privacy erosion,
   surveillance, control, democratic backsliding, hive mentality,
   cyber-utopianism, and dystopianism. This study argues that, due to the
   problematic nature of the Metaverse in terms of its inherent ethical and
   social implications, there need to be more explicit processes and
   practices for enhancing public participation and allowing a more
   democratic public role in its shaping and control, especially early in
   the decision-making process of its development-when the opportunity for
   effective inputs and informed choices is greatest. The novelty of this
   study lies in that it is the first of its kind with respect to probing
   the link between the Metaverse and data-driven smart cities from an STS
   perspective. The main contribution of this study lies in deepening and
   extending social scientific critiques and understandings of the
   imaginaries of data-driven smart cities based on the analysis and
   evaluation of the Metaverse and the warning signals and troubling
   visions it conveys and animates in order to help construct desirable
   alternative futures for the greater good of all citizens. The ultimate
   goal is to structure the Metaverse in ways that are morally acceptable
   and collectively the most democratically beneficial for society.},

   During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study},

Abstract = {Background: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically
   and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase
   of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the
   gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that
   women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by
   the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare,
   elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden
   lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate
   consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop
   in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the
   number of female authors of scientific publications.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that
   the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the
   productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of
   authorship of scientific publications.
   Methods: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We
   investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published
   scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data
   from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals.
   We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the
   expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We
   also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
   test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the
   results.
   Results: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv
   repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354
   unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers
   that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The
   proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field
   during the pandemic dropped by 9.1\%, on average, across disciplines
   (expected arithmetic mean y(est)=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35;
   standard error of the estimate, S-est=0.007; standard error of the
   observation, sigma(x)=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for
   papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female
   scientists in the first author position dropped by 28\% (y(est)=0.39;
   y=0.28; S-est=0.007; sigma(x)=0.007). When looking at the last authors,
   the proportion of women dropped by 7.9\%, on average (y(est)=0.25;
   y=0.23; S-est=0.005; sigma(x)=0.003), while the proportion of women
   writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8\%
   (y(est)=0.25; y=0.21; S-est=0.005; sigma(x)=0.007). Further, by
   geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities
   became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35\% in
   some cases.
   Conclusions: Our findings document a decrease in the number of
   publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global
   pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to
   COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related
   to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was
   persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of
   researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific
   community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the
   disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics.},

Title = {CHECKING SOMEONE ELSE'S PRESENT WITH YOUR OWN PAST (ON THE FORMATION OF
   AN EMIGRE HISTORIOGRAPHIC NARRATIVE)},
Journal = {VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the historiographic texts of the first wave of
   Russian emigre historians. In these texts, the Soviet historiographic
   process of the 1920s and 1930s was interpreted. The relevance of the
   study is associated both with the poor study of historiographic texts
   created during that period in emigration, and with the narrative turn of
   modern historical science, as well as with the experience of
   understanding the structure and nature of the Soviet narrative, which is
   beginning to be comprehended and problematized as an independent
   problem. The study of narratives makes it possible to move away from
   general assessments of the Soviet stage of historical studies to a more
   specific description of it through studying the stylistics of the text,
   isolating the standards and the uniqueness of their construction, with
   close attention to the problems of their unification. This process can
   be clarified and refined through the prism of the ``emigre mirror{''}.
   The source base was the historiographic texts of P.N. Milyukov, A.A.
   Kizevetter, A.V. Florovsky, and E.F. Maksimovich in the form of
   published works and manuscript heritage from the archives of the Russian
   Academy of Sciences (ARAN) and the Slavic Library in Prague (Slovanska
   knihovna v Praze). Based on textual analysis and developments in the
   field of intellectual history, the author highlights the unifying
   features of the emigre narrative. These include: 1) scholars'
   understanding of their special mission in emigration which consists of
   preserving the historiographic tradition and presenting Russian
   historical science to the world community as part of world science; 2)
   close attention to the classics, focus on tradition; 3) an assessment of
   the historiographic process within the framework of the reference time,
   the Golden age of pre-revolutionary historical science (late 19th -
   early 20th centuries); the criterion for assessing the current
   historiographic process was the compliance with the experience of Moscow
   and St. Petersburg scientific schools; 4) a statement about the lack of
   freedom of research, the monopoly of Marxist methodology and the
   hypertrophied class approach in relation to the historicist views of
   historians; 5) changes in the form and structure of the classic
   narrative - the proportion of reviews, literature reviews, obituaries in
   the structure of emigrant narrative was increasing; the deconstruction
   of the old narrative followed the path of its archaization; 6) the
   unifying factor that tightened the texts, gave them tension and a
   special emotional charge, was the figure of M.N. Pokrovsky. However, the
   verification of the current historiographic process by one's own past is
   not without contradictions. On the one hand, this ensures the continuity
   of historiographic knowledge and confirms the thesis of the intrinsic
   value of the so-called ``outdated innovations{''}. In addition, in this
   regard, we can talk about the fundamental eclecticism of science as a
   cultural tradition. On the other hand, the reciprocating nature is
   fraught with a closure on the old. The absolutization of tradition leads
   to the blocking of intellectual transfers. In science of science, this
   process is called the rut effect. As an example of searching for ``one's
   own track{''}, the article presents an attempt by A.V. Florovsky to
   understand and to clarify the phenomenon of Soviet historiography by
   coarsening the classical historiographic approach and using the
   inventory-registration method.
   As a result, he managed to present the meaningful complexity of the
   internal structure of Soviet historical science.},

	abstract = {According to representatives of the exact sciences, as well as philosophers and methodologists of the humanities, the epistemological status of pedagogy today is quite low. There are no verified regulations for the empirical, theoretical and contextual substantiation of conclusions and methods for obtaining them; the voices of the theoreticians of pedagogical science about the structure and component composition of pedagogical theory sound polyphonic. The differences between theory and concept, long recognized in the science of science, do not find the right understanding and response in pedagogical works. Pedagogy, being an integral member of the community of human sciences, must today enter into an active and meaningful scientific dialogue with methodologists, science scholars, humanists, who represent a “strong” version of human knowledge. Described by the famous Russian philosopher L.A. Mikeshina’s methodological dialogues prompted us to take up the urgently required concretization of the author’s interesting conclusions and arguments in relation to the methodology of pedagogy which L.A. Mikeshina presents as transfer of terms (extrapolation). Based on the analysis of the cited book and many works of philosophers and teachers, we managed to build a triad of criteria for correct extrapolation of terms: a) address correctness; correspondence of the pedagogical sound of the term transferred to pedagogy to that which is accepted in donor science; b) the creative focus of the transferred term; c) detachment from repetition of the well-known method of noise stylistic reproduction. As one of the examples of the transfer of knowledge into pedagogy, the author considers the absorption by the science of education of the stylistics of related sciences based on scientific metaphors. The second part of the article is devoted to the theoretical construction of pedagogy. A methodological screen of a particular pedagogical theory is presented, white spots of the topic are revealed, the idea of theoretical constructions in pedagogy, reflected qualitatively and quantitatively, is proposed. The connection between the problem of knowledge transfer (1) and the theoretical construction of pedagogy (2) is shown. © The Authors.},

Traditional data exporting from companies’ websites is not sufficient, so APIs are used to access a larger corpus. Therefore, this study aims not only to establish a taxonomy but also to offer a comparative analysis of 44 bibliographic APIs from various non-profit and commercial organizations, analyzing their characteristics and metadata with descriptive analysis, their possible bibliometric analyses, and the interoperability of the APIs across four different data categories: general, content, search, and query modes. The study found that Clarivate Analytics and Elsevier offer highly versatile APIs, while non-profit organizations, such as OpenCitations and OurResearch promote the Open Science philosophy. Most organizations offer free access to APIs for non-commercial purposes, but some have limitations on metadata retrieval. However, CrossRef, OpenCitations, or OpenAlex have no restrictions on the metadata retrieval. Co-author analysis using author names and bibliometric evaluation using citations are the types of analyses that can be done with the data provided by most APIs. DOI, PubMedID, and PMCID are the most versatile identifiers for extending metadata in the APIs. Semantic Scholar, Dimensions, ORCID, and Embase are the APIs that offer the most extensibility. Considering the obtained results, there is no single API that gathers all the information needed to perform any bibliometric analysis. Combining two or more APIs may be the most appropriate option to cover as much information as possible and enrich reports and analyses. This study contributes to advancing the understanding and use of APIs in research practice. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {What conditions enable novel intellectual contributions to diffuse and become integrated into later scientific work? Prior work tends to focus on whole cultural products, such as patents and articles, and emphasizes external social factors as important. This article focuses on concepts as reflections of ideas, and we identify the combined influence that social factors and internal intellectual structures have on ideational diffusion. To develop this perspective, we use computational techniques to identify nearly 60,000 new ideas introduced over two decades (1993 to 2016) in the Web of Science and follow their diffusion across 38 million later publications. We find new ideas diffuse more widely when they socially and intellectually resonate. New ideas become core concepts of science when they reach expansive networks of unrelated authors, achieve consistent intellectual usage, are associated with other prominent ideas, and fit with extant research traditions. These ecological conditions play an increasingly decisive role later in an idea’s career, after their relations with the environment are established. This work advances the systematic study of scientific ideas by moving beyond products to focus on the content of ideas themselves and applies a relational perspective that takes seriously the contingency of their success. © American Sociological Association 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: Improving rigor and transparency measures should lead to improvements in reproducibility across the scientific literature; however, the assessment of measures of transparency tends to be very difficult if performed manually. Objective: This study addresses the enhancement of the Rigor and Transparency Index (RTI, version 2.0), which attempts to automatically assess the rigor and transparency of journals, institutions, and countries using manuscripts scored on criteria found in reproducibility guidelines (eg, Materials Design, Analysis, and Reporting checklist criteria). Methods: The RTI tracks 27 entity types using natural language processing techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Conditional Random Field-based models and regular expressions; this allowed us to assess over 2 million papers accessed through PubMed Central. Results: Between 1997 and 2020 (where data were readily available in our data set), rigor and transparency measures showed general improvement (RTI 2.29 to 4.13), suggesting that authors are taking the need for improved reporting seriously. The top-scoring journals in 2020 were the Journal of Neurochemistry (6.23), British Journal of Pharmacology (6.07), and Nature Neuroscience (5.93). We extracted the institution and country of origin from the author affiliations to expand our analysis beyond journals. Among institutions publishing >1000 papers in 2020 (in the PubMed Central open access set), Capital Medical University (4.75), Yonsei University (4.58), and University of Copenhagen (4.53) were the top performers in terms of RTI. In country-level performance, we found that Ethiopia and Norway consistently topped the RTI charts of countries with 100 or more papers per year. In addition, we tested our assumption that the RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability (ie, a high RTI represents papers containing sufficient information for replication efforts). Using work by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we determined that replication papers (RTI 7.61, SD 0.78) scored significantly higher (P < .001) than the original papers (RTI 3.39, SD 1.12), which according to the project required additional information from authors to begin replication efforts. Conclusions: These results align with our view that RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability. Unfortunately, RTI measures for journals, institutions, and countries fall short of the replicated paper average. If we consider the RTI of these replication studies as a target for future manuscripts, more work will be needed to ensure that the average manuscript contains sufficient information for replication attempts. © Joe Menke, Peter Eckmann, Ibrahim Burak Ozyurt, Martijn Roelandse, Nathan Anderson, Jeffrey Grethe, Anthony Gamst, Anita Bandrowski.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to map the knowledge management research in small businesses and suggest future actions to strengthen managerial practices. Knowledge management practices foster the growth of small businesses. They allow innovation to grow within the institutions, enhance customer satisfaction and reduce employee absenteeism and attrition. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a bibliometric protocol to retrieve the 686 articles published in the Web of Science (WoS) database. The WoS database is selected to ensure only quality and peer-reviewed publications are analysed in the study. It then identifies the top contributions, and existing thematic areas, and suggests future research and policy actions for boosting economic growth through small business. The study uses VOSviewer, Science of Science (Sci2) and Gephi to conduct the bibliometric and network analysis. Findings: The results from keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analysis helps in identifying thematic areas. The findings highlight that there exist five major themes in knowledge management research for small businesses. The dynamic co-citation analysis helps in tracing the evolution of these clusters and suggests future themes, research directions and methodological advances in the theme. PageRank analysis helps in identifying the top articles published on high-impact journals in the theme. Research limitations/implications: The study helps researchers by summarising existing literature and identifying key thematic areas. It also assists policymakers by recommending actions to improve knowledge management practises in small businesses to gain a competitive advantage. The paper suffers from the limitations of bibliometric analysis. The sample is collected from a single data source and a single type (journal articles) and the statistical accuracy of the analysis depends on the quality of the sample. Originality/value: The study’s originality lies in using fit-for-purpose software in clustering the research and suggesting actions. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of its kind in applying bibliometrics in studying and covering several aspects of knowledge management in small businesses with a combination of software. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Scientific Testimony concerns the roles of scientific testimony in science and society. The book develops a positive alternative to a tradition famously expressed by the slogan of the Royal Society Nullius in verba ("Take nobody's word for it"). This book argues that intra-scientific testimony--i.e., testimony between collaborating scientists--is not in conflict with the spirit of science or an add-on to scientific practice. On the contrary, intra-scientific testimony is a vital part of science. This is illustrated by articulating epistemic norms of intra-scientific testimony and arguing that they are vital to scientific methodology on a par with other scientific norms governing scientific observation and data analysis. The book also provides an account of public scientific testimony--i.e., scientific testimony to the lay population. This is done by integrating philosophical resources with empirical research on the science of science communication. For example, various misconceptions about science and folk epistemological biases are diagnosed as factors that contribute to science skepticism. This diagnosis provides the basis for developing novel norms for science communication that are sensitive to the psychological and social obstacles to laypersons' uptake of it. Finally, the volume discusses how public scientific testimony is best embedded in society and argues that it is critical for societies that pursue the ideals of deliberative democracy. Scientific Testimony draws on philosophy of science, social epistemology, and empirical research to provide a wide-ranging account of the roles of scientific testimony within scientific practice and within the wider society. © Mikkel Gerken 2022.},

This article investigates which broad academic fields use questionnaires, whether this use is increasing, and whether it generates average citation impact. This is investigated through a nonprobability sample: articles mentioning questionnaires in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. This procedure captures a minority of research using questionnaires, with substantial biases against fields using alternative terminology, such as ‘instrument’ or ‘survey’, or that rarely explicitly mention questionnaires in titles, abstract or keywords because they play a minor role. The results suggest that the proportion of journal articles using questionnaires tripled between 1996 and 2019, and this proportion increased in all 27 broad Scopus fields. Over the same period, the citation impact of the identified research declined from above average to below average. Thus, whilst academic research seems to be increasingly using questionnaires, the quality or scholarly value of research using questionnaires may be declining. These are tentative conclusions because of the unknown sampling bias for the set of questionnaire-based articles analysed. © 2021 The Authors. Learned Publishing © 2021 ALPSP.},

It finds that notions of the nature of data vary widely, and are often contradictory. Complexities are identified in the approach to data as both documents and as records. In the process of this analysis, it identifies the essential question of whether [research] data is given or taken: Is data found/identified by the researcher, or is it created? Arguments for both approaches are fleshed out, providing a basis for further work in information science in this essential space.

	abstract = {Dominance hierarchies have been studied for almost 100 years. The science of science approach used here provides high-level insight into how the dynamics of dominance hierarchy research have shifted over this long timescale. To summarize these patterns, I extracted publication metadata using a Google Scholar search for the phrase 'dominance hierarchy', resulting in over 26 000 publications. I used text mining approaches to assess patterns in three areas: (1) general patterns in publication frequency and rate, (2) dynamics of term usage and (3) term co-occurrence in publications across the history of the field. While the overall number of publications per decade continues to rise, the percent growth rate has fallen in recent years, demonstrating that although there is sustained interest in dominance hierarchies, the field is no longer experiencing the explosive growth it showed in earlier decades. Results from title term co-occurrence networks and community structure show that the different subfields of dominance hierarchy research were most strongly separated early in the field's history while modern research shows more evidence for cohesion and a lack of distinct term community boundaries. These methods provide a general view of the history of research on dominance hierarchies and can be applied to other fields or search terms to gain broad synthetic insight into patterns of interest, especially in fields with large bodies of literature.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper throws light on some of the nature of artificial intelligence (AI) development, which will serve as a starter for helping to advance its development. Design/methodology/approach: This work reveals the evolutions and trends of AI from four dimensions: research, output, influence and competition through leveraging academic knowledge graph with 130,750 AI scholars and 43,746 scholarly articles. Findings: The authors unearth that the “research convergence” phenomenon becomes more evident in current AI research for scholars' highly similar research interests in different regions. The authors notice that Pareto's principle applies to AI scholars' outputs, and the outputs have been increasing at an explosive rate in the past two decades. The authors discover that top works dominate the AI academia, for they attracted considerable attention. Finally, the authors delve into AI competition, which accelerates technology development, talent flow, and collaboration. Originality/value: The work aims to throw light on the nature of AI development, which will serve as a starter for helping to advance its development. The work will help us to have a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the evolutions and trends, which bridge the gap between literature research and AI development as well as enlighten the way the authors promote AI development and its strategy formulation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Our analysis highlights common patterns across similar research systems, and shows how developing nations (China in particular) are quickly catching up with the developed world. This paints the picture of a general growth of scientific and technical capabilities of nations induced by the spreading of information typical of the scientific environment. Shifting the focus of the analysis to the regional level, we find that even developed nations display a considerable level of inequality in the Scientific Fitness of their internal regions. Further, we assess comparatively how the competitiveness of each geographic region is distributed over the spectrum of research sectors. Overall, the Scientific Fitness represents the first high quality estimation of the scientific strength of nations and regions, opening new policy-making applications for better allocating resources, filling inequality gaps and ultimately promoting innovation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper aims to find the reasons why some citation models can predict a set of specific bibliometric indices extremely well. We show why fitting a model that preserves the total sum of a vector can be beneficial in the case of heavy-tailed data that are frequently observed in informetrics and similar disciplines. Based on this observation, we introduce the reparameterised versions of the discrete generalised beta distribution (DGBD) and power law models that preserve the total sum of elements in a citation vector and, as a byproduct, they enjoy much better predictive power when predicting many bibliometric indices as well as partial cumulative sums. This also results in the underlying model parameters' being easier to fit numerically. Moreover, they are also more interpretable. Namely, just like in our recently-introduced 3DSI (three dimensions of scientific impact) model, we have a clear distinction between the coefficients determining the total productivity (size), total impact (sum), and those that affect the shape of the resulting theoretical curve.  © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The international migration of researchers is an important dimension of scientific mobility, and has been the subject of considerable policy debate. However, tracking the migration life courses of researchers is challenging due to data limitations. In this study, we use Scopus bibliometric data on eight million publications from 1.1 million researchers who have published at least once with an affiliation address from Germany in 1996–2020. We construct the partial life histories of published researchers in this period and explore both their out-migration and the subsequent return of a subset of this group: the returnees. Our analyses shed light on the career stages and gender disparities between researchers who remain in Germany, those who emigrate, and those who eventually return. We find that the return migration streams are even more gender imbalanced, which points to the need for additional efforts to encourage female researchers to come back to Germany. We document a slightly declining trend in return migration among more recent cohorts of researchers who left Germany, which, for most disciplines, was associated with a decrease in the German collaborative ties of these researchers. Moreover, we find that the gender disparities for the most gender imbalanced disciplines are unlikely to be mitigated by return migration given the gender compositions of the cohorts of researchers who have left Germany and of those who have returned. This analysis uncovers new dimensions of migration among scholars by investigating the return migration of published researchers, which is critical for the development of science policy. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We find homophily between identities and topic, suggesting a relationship between diversity in the scientific workforce and expansion of the knowledge base. However, topic selection comes at a cost to minoritized individuals for whom we observe both between- and within-topic citation disadvantages. To enhance the robustness of science, research organizations should provide adequate resources to historically underfunded research areas while simultaneously providing access for minoritized individuals into high-prestige networks and topics. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {The science of urban planning has drawn on a wide range of disciplines and research perspectives. This makes it challenging to define the boundaries and directions of the field. Here, nearly 100,000 articles on urban planning are analysed to objectively determine divisions, temporal trends and influential references and actors of urban planning. In terms of the structural composition, four broad divisions are identified: (1) governance and policy, (2) economics and markets, (3) housing and (4) built and natural environment. In terms of the temporal evolution, the earliest trends were related to “welfare economics”, “agglomeration economies”, “urban economics”, and “urban growth machine”. During the 1980s and 1990s, the focus moved towards “regional policy and development”, “social welfare”, and “urban renaissance”. This trend continued during the 2000s and 2010s, heading to “urban morphology”, “participatory planning”, “urban sociology”, “global cities”, and “political economy”. The field has recently headed towards areas of “resilience”, “smart cities” and “urban green space”. These transitions have been derivative, and the paradigm shifts have been very gradual. Another key observation is a notable increase in author connectivity and international collaboration. The results provide objective insights into how the science of urban planning has historically transitioned and where it is headed. © 2023 The Authors},

In recent decades, research funding plays an increasingly important role in scientific research. Thus, it is progressively significant for management authorities to measure the research efficiency of highly funded scientists, which can be helpful for them to make effective policies. However, few researchers use quantitative analysis to study these issues. To promote the research in this field, we begin with collecting a dataset. This dataset contains research funding and other information from 345 highly funded scientists in Mainland China. Next, we use the dataset to measure the efficiency of highly funded scientists based on the data envelopment analysis. In this way, highly funded scientists are placed into several levels according to their research inputs and outputs. We also give their attractiveness and progress scores compared to other grades. The learning path for less efficient scientists is also provided. We find that highly funded scientists have relatively high efficiency in three kinds of projects, such as the Major Research Plan. Besides, the career length and career start year are demonstrated to have a limited impact on the highly funded scientists. These patterns are beneficial for the development of the scientific community and management authorities to make policies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {What science does, what science could do, and how to make science work? If we want to know the answers to these questions, we need to be able to uncover the mechanisms of science, going beyond metrics that are easily collectible and quantifiable. In this perspective piece, we link metrics to mechanisms by demonstrating how emerging metrics of science not only offer complementaries to existing ones, but also shed light on the hidden structure and mechanisms of science. Based on fundamental properties of science, we classify existing theories and findings into: hot and cold science referring to attention shift between scientific fields, fast and slow science reflecting productivity of scientists and teams, soft and hard science revealing reproducibility of scientific research. We suggest that interest about mechanisms of science since Derek J. de Solla Price, Robert K. Merton, Eugene Garfield, and many others complement the zeitgeist in pursuing new, complex metrics without understanding the underlying processes. We propose that understanding and modeling the mechanisms of science condition effective development and application of metrics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, we have witnessed the emergence of several knowledge graphs that explicitly describe research knowledge with the aim of enabling intelligent systems for supporting and accelerating the scientific process. These resources typically characterize a set of entities in this space (e.g., tasks, methods, evaluation techniques, proteins, chemicals), their relations, and the relevant actors (e.g., researchers, organizations) and documents (e.g., articles, books). However, they are usually very partial representations of the actual research knowledge and may miss several relevant facts. In this paper, we introduce SciCheck, a new triple classification approach for completing scientific statements in knowledge graphs. SciCheck was evaluated against other state-of-the-art approaches on seven benchmarks, yielding excellent results. Finally, we provide a real-world use case and applied SciCheck to the Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Graph (AI-KG), a large-scale automatically-generated open knowledge graph including 1.2M statements extracted from the 333K most cited articles in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and generated a new version of this knowledge graph with 300K additional triples.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Economists have engaged with AI since its beginnings, albeit in varying degrees and with changing focus across time and places. In this study, we have explored the diffusion of AI and different AI methods (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, expert systems, knowledge-based systems) through and within economic subfields, taking a scientometrics approach. In particular, we centre our accompanying discussion of AI in economics around the problems of economic calculation and social planning as proposed by Hayek. To map the history of AI within and between economic sub-fields, we construct two datasets containing bibliometrics information of economics papers based on search query results from the Scopus database and the EconPapers (and IDEAs/RePEc) repository. We present descriptive results that map the use and discussion of AI in economics over time, place, and subfield. In doing so, we also characterise the authors and affiliations of those engaging with AI in economics. Additionally, we find positive correlations between quality of institutional affiliation and engagement with or focus on AI in economics and negative correlations between the Human Development Index and share of learning-based AI papers. © 2022, The Author(s).},

The methodology was developed from the dialectical paradigm and qualitative approach, with the participation of 40 experts from 10 countries and four doctoral groups; the methods of systematization of experience and grounded theory were combined; the expert interview was used, complemented by a focus group in 4 doctoral groups and the content analysis of 50 doctoral theses. The results of the interview confirm 16 themes and four macro categories that help to understand what scientific novelty is, how it is evidenced in the text, its qualities, how it is constructed and what is the role of the philosophy of science in this process; The focus group evidenced difficulties of the doctoral students in the execution of the phase of epistemic transcendence of the theoretical construction method, for which reason they proceeded to elaborate reflexive, didactic and methodological guidelines based on the content analysis of doctoral theses and the systematization of experiences. and professional training experiences that explain how scientific novelty is specified in a doctoral thesis. © 2022, Universidad del Zulia.

	abstract = {For decades the number of scientific publications has been rapidly increasing, effectively out-dating knowledge at a tremendous rate. Only few scientific milestones remain relevant and continuously attract citations. Here we quantify how long scientific work remains being utilized, how long it takes before today's work is forgotten, and how milestone papers differ from those forgotten. To answer these questions, we study the complete temporal citation network of all American Physical Society journals. We quantify the probability of attracting citations for individual publications based on age and the number of citations they have received in the past. We capture both aspects, the forgetting and the tendency to cite already popular works, in a microscopic generative model for the dynamics of scientific citation networks. We find that the probability of citing a specific paper declines with age as a power law with an exponent of α ∼-1.4. Whenever a paper in its early years can be characterized by a scaling exponent above a critical value, α c, the paper is likely to become 'ever-lasting'. We validate the model with out-of-sample predictions, with an accuracy of up to 90% (area under the curve ∼0.9). The model also allows us to estimate an expected citation landscape of the future, predicting that 95% of papers cited in 2050 have yet to be published. The exponential growth of articles, combined with a power-law type of forgetting and papers receiving fewer and fewer citations on average, suggests a worrying tendency toward information overload and raises concerns about scientific publishing's long-term sustainability.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: With the availability of large-scale scholarly datasets, scientists from various domains hope to understand the underlying mechanisms behind science, forming a vibrant area of inquiry in the emerging "science of science"field. As the results from the science of science often has strong policy implications, understanding the causal relationships between variables becomes prominent. However, the most credible quasi-experimental method among all causal inference methods, and a highly valuable tool in the empirical toolkit, Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) has not been fully exploited in the field of science of science. In this paper, we provide a systematic survey of the RDD method, and its practical applications in the science of science. Design/methodology/approach: First, we introduce the basic assumptions, mathematical notations, and two types of RDD, i.e., sharp and fuzzy RDD. Second, we use the Web of Science and the Microsoft Academic Graph datasets to study the evolution and citation patterns of RDD papers. Moreover, we provide a systematic survey of the applications of RDD methodologies in various scientific domains, as well as in the science of science. Finally, we demonstrate a case study to estimate the effect of Head Start Funding Proposals on child mortality. Findings: RDD was almost neglected for 30 years after it was first introduced in 1960. Afterward, scientists used mathematical and economic tools to develop the RDD methodology. After 2010, RDD methods showed strong applications in various domains, including medicine, psychology, political science and environmental science. However, we also notice that the RDD method has not been well developed in science of science research. Research Limitations: This work uses a keyword search to obtain RDD papers, which may neglect some related work. Additionally, our work does not aim to develop rigorous mathematical and technical details of RDD but rather focuses on its intuitions and applications. Practical implications: This work proposes how to use the RDD method in science of science research. Originality/value: This work systematically introduces the RDD, and calls for the awareness of using such a method in the field of science of science.  © 2023 Meiling Li et al., published by Sciendo.},

With the assistance of AMiner tools and datasets, this paper aims to describe a further explicit context and evolution of AI in the past decade from the development of connectionist approaches. Five aspects of the past decade are highlighted: self-learning and self-coding algorithms, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) algorithms, reinforcement learning, pre-trained models, and other typical deep learning algorithms, which represent the significant progress of this field. By combining these critical parts, we then summarize the current limitations and corresponding future of AI trends in the next decade and discuss some topics about the next generation of AI.

Here, we probe the impact of questionable publications through a systematic and comprehensive analysis with various participants from academia and compare the results with those of their unaccused counterparts using billions of citation records, including liaisons, i.e., journals and publishers, and prosumers, i.e., authors. Questionable publications attribute publisher-level self-citations to their journals while limiting journal-level self-citations; yet, conventional journal-level metrics are unable to detect these publisher-level self-citations. We propose a hybrid journal-publisher metric for detecting self-favouring citations among QJs from publishers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the questionable publications were less disruptive and influential than their counterparts. Our findings indicate an inflated citation impact of suspicious academic publishers. The findings provide a basis for actionable policy-making against questionable publications. © 2022 The Authors.},

Diana (Ding) Dyason who headed the first HPS department in the southern hemisphere is honoured by this annual lecture, the text of which constitutes this article. Thomas Kuhn's influential lecture in Oxford in 1961 inspired her work on the history of scientific entanglement with social concerns, and the directions of HPS at the University of Melbourne. Post-war reconstruction was both a local and a national project for every nation, very much in the air in the 1940s, and influential until the 1970s. The Australasian Association of Scientific Workers (AASW) brought together scientists too old to serve, or, in reserved occupations, to undertake their own 'war effort' on the question of: 'What comes next?' AASW held a planning conference in Sydney in 1944 to 'formulate a policy on the organisation of science necessary to meet the demands of post-war Australia'. They set out to consider the role of the 'the scientific method' in the welfare of society. In particular, they recognised their existing international scientific networks and connections could become valuable for post-war collaborations between different sciences and different nations of benefit to Australia and the world. The idea of 'the environment' was one of many that emerged internationally in these 'world-minded' times, an idea that focused on the management of nature for the benefit of people using the scientific method. National Parks were a crucial discussion point, bringing together amateur naturalists and professional environmental managers of all sorts in discussions about landscape planning along with international comparative work on reserving places for wild animals and plants. This Dyason Lecture explores the emergence of 'integrated science', of science in the service of society, that later included natural resource management, big science, environmental science, earth systems science and climate science. It begins with the tragedy of the 'dirty thirties', when soil was in the air, and the scientific response to concerns about feeding the world. © 2022 CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Current practices of quantifying academic performance by productivity raise serious concerns about the psychological well-being of graduate students. These efforts often neglect the influence of researchers’ environment. Acknowledgments in dissertation subsections shed light on this environment by providing an opportunity for students to thank the people who supported them. We analysed 26,236 acknowledgments to create an “academic support network” that reveals five distinct communities that support students along the way: Academic, Administration, Family, Friends & Colleagues, and Spiritual. We show that female students mention fewer people from each of these communities, with the exception of their families, and that their productivity is slightly lower than that of males when considering the number of publications alone. This is critically important because it means that studying the doctoral process may help us better understand the adverse conditions women face early in their academic careers. Our results also suggest that the total number of people mentioned in the acknowledgements allows disciplines to be categorised as either individual science or team science as their magnitudes change. We also show that male students who mention more people from their academic community are associated with higher levels of productivity. University rankings are found to be positively correlated with productivity and the size of academic support networks. However, neither university rankings nor students’ productivity levels correlate with the sentiments students express in their acknowledgements. Our results point to the importance of academic support networks by explaining how they differ and how they influence productivity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

How are prestige and credit distributed across the discipline? And how do these factors interact with other factors, such as gender, to shape job market outcomes? Using job market data for anglophone academic philosophy, this paper finds, first, evidence that is consistent with the analytic-continental divide but is also consistent with other, more complex ways of organizing academic philosophy into distinct intellectual traditions; second, a clear prestige hierarchy, dividing Ph.D. programs into two distinct prestige categories; and, third, evidence that gender, prestige, and country have notable effects on academic job market outcomes for recent philosophy Ph.Ds. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Although considerable progress toward gender equality in science has been made in recent decades, female researchers continue to face significant barriers in the academic labor market. International mobility has been increasingly recognized as a strategy for scientists to expand their professional networks, and that could help narrow the gender gap in academic careers. Using bibliometric data on over 33 million Scopus publications, we provide a global and dynamic view of gendered patterns of transnational scholarly mobility, as measured by volume, distance, diversity, and distribution, from 1998 to 2017. We find that, while female researchers continued to be underrepresented among internationally mobile researchers and migrate over shorter distances, this gender gap was narrowing at a faster rate than the gender gap in the population of general active researchers. Globally, the origin and destination countries of both female and male mobile researchers became increasingly diversified, which suggests that scholarly migration has become less skewed and more globalized. However, the range of origin and destination countries continued to be narrower for women than for men. While the United States remained the leading academic destination worldwide, the shares of both female and male scholarly inflows to that country declined from around 25% to 20% over the study period, partially due to the growing relevance of China. This study offers a cross-national measurement of gender inequality in global scholarly migration that is essential for promoting gender-equitable science policies and for monitoring the impact of such interventions.

Being an essential element of the economics of science, it has become a matter of scientific inquiry attracting efforts from fields as different as network analysis and bibliometrics. The studies have provided insights into the local structure of collaboration networks, relations between the team composition and research impact. However, the laws governing research collaboration at the (macro)scale of countries and institutions are yet to be established. In this work, a simple yet unexpectedly accurate logarithmic relation between measures of the research output and self-reliance is demonstrated. Restriction of co-authorship analysis to high-ranking journals suppresses geographical and cultural differences to expose universalities in the international research collaboration. The emerging law holds across research areas; it benchmarks collaboration patterns of research institutions grouped by type or country. The self-organized regularity of the collaboration dynamics manifests an important role of national research systems in globalized science, may have profound implications for research policy development and implementation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

This imbalance can be seen at several levels, including in university and industry, where men are the majority of the posts. Academic success is partly dependent on the value of the researchers’ co-authorship networks. One of the ways to enrich one’s network is through academic movement; the change of institutions in search of better opportunities within the same country or internationally. In this paper, we look at the data for one specific pSTEM field, Computer Science, and describe the productivity and co-authorship patterns that emerge as a function of academic mobility. We find that women and men both benefit from national and international mobility, women who never change affiliations over their career are rarely well-cited or highly productive, and women are not well-represented in the overall top-ranking researchers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The article comments on the famous paper by Boris Hessen “The Social and Economic Roots of Newton’s Principia” presented at the Second International Congress on the History of Science and Technology in London in 1931. The comments are made in the light of considerations on the methodology of the historiography of science, including the author’s ideas of research hermeneutics and the research hermeneutics of the historiography of science, the biography of Boris Hessen, the history of scientific historiography, the history of science and the history of science-of-science. The article synthetically presents Hessen’s research hermeneutics and points to its fundamental disadvantages. It describes the reception of Hessen’s paper in the West: both the more widely known positive reception (of Bernalists and their successors, including supporters of Marxist studies of science and the social history of science), and the much less known negative reception (members of the (British) Society for Freedom in Science, members of the Harvard group of J. B. Conant of General Education in Science). The article also presents the changing fate of the reception of Hessen’s thoughts in the USSR and Russia in the years 1930–2020. Additionally, it indicates various historiographic myths related to “Boris Hessen”, including the myth that the Polish science-of-science (Polish: naukoznawstwo) emerged later or at the same time as Russian science-of-science (Russian: науковедение, naukovedenie). The defectiveness of Hessen’s research hermeneutics on the one hand, and on the other hand the reception of his views in the West and in the USSR and Russia from the 1930s to the 2020s, including the various historiographic myths related to Hessen, show how paradoxical the history of the historiography of science can be, and demonstrate the need to cultivate the skills of critical thinking among researchers interpreting science (i.e. historians of science, philosophers of science, sociologists of scientific knowledge, etc.). © 2022, Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences,Commission on the History of Science.

	abstract = {Newton’s centuries-old wisdom of standing on the shoulders of giants raises a crucial yet underexplored question: Out of all the prior works cited by a discovery, which one is its giant? Here, we develop a discipline-independent method to identify the giant for any individual paper, allowing us to better understand the role and characteristics of giants in science. We find that across disciplines, about 95% of papers appear to stand on the shoulders of giants, yet the weight of scientific progress rests on relatively few shoulders. Defining a new measure of giant index, we find that, while papers with high citations are more likely to be giants, for papers with the same citations, their giant index sharply predicts a paper’s future impact and prize-winning probabilities. Giants tend to originate from both small and large teams, being either highly disruptive or highly developmental. Papers that did not have a giant tend to do poorly on average, yet interestingly, if such papers later became a giant for other papers, they tend to be home-run papers that are highly disruptive to science. Given the crucial importance of citation-based measures in science, the developed concept of giants may offer a useful dimension in assessing scientific impact that goes beyond sheer citation counts. © 2022 Woo Seong Jo, Lu Liu, and Dashun Wang.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analyses on delayed recognition indicated by slow-cited papers, including delayed papers and durable papers, have long been discussed to reveal why outstanding discoveries remain unnoticed. However, these analyses include contradictory arguments, such as which combinations of knowledge, over-specialization, or transdisciplinary factors have led to undervaluation. We claim that this is because the indicators of delayed recognition are methodologically similar but capture conceptually different phenomena. Subsequently, this paper examined the overlap of 11 slow-cited measures to identify the uniformity and inconsistency of delayed recognition. Consequently, each measure practically obtained different papers as delayed recognition objectively classified into four groups by citation feature clustering, albeit based on similar concepts. Despite the ambiguity, we found that all delayed recognition measures extract papers that are more likely to be single-author projects that make disruptive contributions to more diverse fields without extremely novel nor conventional knowledge combinations that have been gradually awakened, compared to the null models. This result is robust when applying other hyperparameters, research topic-controlled null models, year-controlled null models, and other fields. This strongly indicates that delayed recognition leads to the reconstruction of a new direction of science and contributes to pioneering a revolutionary research topic.

Despite decades-long efforts to increase gender diversity, however, women remain a small minority in many fields, especially in senior positions. The dearth of elite women scientists, in turn, leaves fewer women to serve as mentors and role models for young women scientists. To shed light on gender disparities in science, we study prominent scholars who were elected to the National Academy of Sciences. We construct author citation networks that capture the structure of recognition among scholars’ peers. We identify gender disparities in the patterns of peer citations and show that these differences are strong enough to accurately predict the scholar’s gender. In contrast, we do not observe disparities due to prestige, with few significant differences in the structure of citations of scholars affiliated with high-ranked and low-ranked institutions. These results provide further evidence that a scholar’s gender plays a role in the mechanisms of success in science. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.},

Frequently, citation networks are created using articles acquired from a set of relevant keywords or queries. Here, we study the robustness of citation networks communities with regards to the keywords that were used for collecting the respective articles. A perturbation approach is proposed, in which the influence of missing keywords on the community structure of citation networks is quantified. In addition, the relationship between keywords and the community structure of citation networks is studied using networks generated from a simple model. We find that, owing to its highly modular structure, the community structure of citation networks tends to be preserved even when many relevant keywords are left out. Furthermore, the proposed model can reflect the impact of missing keywords on different situations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Video communication has been rapidly increasing over the past decade, with YouTube providing a medium where users can post, discover, share, and react to videos. There has also been an increase in the number of videos citing research articles, especially since it has become relatively commonplace for academic conferences to require video submissions. However, the relationship between research articles and YouTube videos is not clear, and the purpose of the present paper is to address this issue. We created new datasets using YouTube videos and mentions of research articles on various online platforms. We found that most of the articles cited in the videos are related to medicine and biochemistry. We analyzed these datasets through statistical techniques and visualization, and built machine learning models to predict (1) whether a research article is cited in videos, (2) whether a research article cited in a video achieves a level of popularity, and (3) whether a video citing a research article becomes popular. The best models achieved F1 scores between 80% and 94%. According to our results, research articles mentioned in more tweets and news coverage have a higher chance of receiving video citations. We also found that video views are important for predicting citations and increasing research articles’ popularity and public engagement with science. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Scientific awards play incentive roles in advancing scientists’ future career development, however, it is not clear how winning a scientific prize influences a scientist's future career persistence and performance across different disciplines and different career stages. To this end, we curated a representative dataset covering 1466 prizewinning scientists from 35 prestigious scientific prizes in seven disciplines. To investigate the potential benefits of one's academic career following the receipt of a prize, we matched each prizewinner with contenders to make sure that the winner and the contenders have comparable academic performance before prizewinning. Then the future performance of prizewinners and contenders in the same group are compared on three dimensions – productivity, scientific impact, and career persistence. Our findings suggest that after winning a prestigious prize, scientists generally publish more papers and receive more citations compared to their contenders. As for persistence, the Kaplan-Meier estimates on career length after the prizewinning show that scientists tend to maintain a longer active research career if their scientific merit are recognized via prizewinning. In addition, when dividing the prizewinners into three subgroups which are young, middle-aged, and senior prizewinners, we found that scientists tend to maintain a longer active career if they win prizes at the young or middle-aged career stage, while the difference is not significant between senior prizewinners and their contenders. Finally, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model and found that the hazards of ending the academic career for young and middle-aged prizewinners are 59.5% and 31.1% lower than their contenders, respectively. This work highlights the importance of scientific merit recognition for scientists at their earlier career stage and provides strong implications for scientists’ career development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Academia is a competitive world where researchers are judged by their productivity, and their strategies to get visibility and success (i.e., number of citations) vary. In addition to conducting rigorous research, there are social strategies that influence authors’ and their papers’ level of citations. The author’s position in the co-authorship network affects the success of their papers. Hence, we want to understand if the authors’ segregation in the co-authorship network relates to citations gained by a paper over time. We address this question by examining the patterns in Computer Science from 1975 to 2015 (and citations until 2020) from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. Specifically, we identify communities in the co-authorship network and classify them into segregation categories and core positions. Then, we compare the citation histories of papers written in those communities. We examine papers written solely by members of the same community (internal) and different communities (external), resulting in the following five categories: internal highly-segregated, internal non-segregated, external highly-segregated, external non-segregated, and external mixed. Our results show that from 1998 to 2010, internal highly-segregated papers gained fewer citations than internal non-segregated and external mixed papers. Also, from 2010 to 2015, external mixed papers gained more citations than internal non-segregated papers and even more citations than internal highly-segregated papers. We also found that in the network nucleus (from core decomposition), there is little difference in the citations of internal non- and highly-segregated papers. In contrast, in the network’s periphery, internal non-segregated papers tend to gain more citations than internal highly-segregated papers since 2005. From this work, we conclude that papers written by a more diverse set of authors (measured by their network connectivity) receive more citations over time and that to compensate for the lack of diversity, their authors should be in central positions of the co-authorship network. Hence, this work could incentivise diverse co-authorships and strengthen researchers’ cohesion to increase their papers’ success. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Conjecture about the weak replicability in social sciences has made scholars eager to quantify the scale and scope of replication failure for a discipline. Yet small-scale manual replication methods alone are ill-suited to deal with this big data problem. Here, we conduct a discipline-wide replication census in science. Our sample (N = 14,126 papers) covers nearly all papers published in the six top-tier Psychology journals over the past 20 y. Using a validated machine learning model that estimates a paper’s likelihood of replication, we found evidence that both supports and refutes speculations drawn from a relatively small sample of manual replications. First, we find that a single overall replication rate of Psychology poorly captures the varying degree of replicability among subfields. Second, we find that replication rates are strongly correlated with research methods in all subfields. Experiments replicate at a significantly lower rate than do non-experimental studies. Third, we find that authors’ cumulative publication number and citation impact are positively related to the likelihood of replication, while other proxies of research quality and rigor, such as an author’s university prestige and a paper’s citations, are unrelated to replicability. Finally, contrary to the ideal that media attention should cover replicable research, we find that media attention is positively related to the likelihood of replication failure. Our assessments of the scale and scope of replicability are important next steps toward broadly resolving issues of replicability. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.},

	abstract = {Science demonstrations are a simple, cost-effective method of improving interest in STEM and highlighting the diversity of scientists, which can impact audience members’ sense of belonging and, in turn, influence self-efficacy. However, the pedagogy of science demonstrations has been criticized as creating a power imbalance between the presenter and audience, for being too far removed from the audience’s prior experiences, and for lacking interactivity. We report here on an intervention that designed demonstration-experiments to address a lack of interactivity while supporting interest; contextualized demonstrations within everyday experiences to address a lack of prior experiences and support interest, and implemented a near-peer role modeling strategy through high school near-peer role models to address power imbalances while supporting self-efficacy and expanding fourth-grade students’ perceptions of who can be a scientist. The study explores the effects of the intervention using a pre-post survey design analyzed by repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (rmMANOVA) (n = 444). Significant improvement was observed for all motivational variables. These results suggest that interactive science demonstrations focused on students’ everyday experiences may be an effective strategy to foster STEM interest and self-efficacy and to improve perceptions of who can be a scientist when enacted through high school near-peer role models. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used in food packaging, non-stick pots, and surfactants. However, their persistence in the environment, hazardous nature, and potential for bioaccumulation and long-range transport have alarmed an increasing number of scholars and research institutions. Although several literature reviews on PFASs research exist, only a few of them have considered bibliometric indices. In this study, 3,373 PFASs-related articles published between 2001 and 2018 were analyzed using a bibliometric analysis method based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded. The software tools for mapping knowledge domain (MKD) (VOSviewer and Science of Science (Sci2)) were used to analyze the performance of contributors and PFASs research topics, hotspots, and trends. Our results reveal that the number of PFASs-related articles published annually has increased significantly, with most originating from the United States (followed by those from China). The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published the most articles. A comprehensive analysis of title, keywords, and keywords plus showed that PFASs research hotspots include humans, precursors, and detection methods, with the main focuses being environmental science, toxicology, and environmental engineering. The four main research topics of PFASs were identified, and a literature review was carried out for each one. Overall, this study can supply researchers with a deeper understanding of the development of PFASs studies and provide a comprehensive data reference for researchers to further grasp the research direction in this field. © 2022},

These strategic priorities echo views widely shared within the HSPR community, and we commend IHSPR for its leadership and vision. Recognizing the systemic challenges ahead of us, this commentary considers the HSPR community's capacity to achieve the promise of learning health systems, given the obstacles likely to hinder their rapid scale-up over the next five years. Next, we consider the spread of virtual care during the pandemic to illustrate the embedded and negotiated nature of innovation in health systems and the need for vigilance as to the social distribution of their benefits and costs. Finally, a critical review of the strategic plan provides insights into how research is governed in the HSPR field. Based on this analysis, it appears essential to reconsider health system transformation as social system transformation and strengthen interdisciplinary and comparative research. Looking forward, developing a science of science to better understand the conditions associated with high-impact research should be a cross-cutting priority for Canada's HSPR community. © 2022 Longwoods Publishing Corp..

	abstract = {Purpose: In recent decades, with the availability of large-scale scientific corpus datasets, difference-in-difference (DID) is increasingly used in the science of science and bibliometrics studies. DID method outputs the unbiased estimation on condition that several hypotheses hold, especially the common trend assumption. In this paper, we gave a systematic demonstration of DID in the science of science, and the potential ways to improve the accuracy of DID method. Design/methodology/approach: At first, we reviewed the statistical assumptions, the model specification, and the application procedures of DID method. Second, to improve the necessary assumptions before conducting DID regression and the accuracy of estimation, we introduced some matching techniques serving as the pre-selecting step for DID design by matching control individuals who are equivalent to those treated ones on observational variables before the intervention. Lastly, we performed a case study to estimate the effects of prizewinning on the scientific performance of Nobel laureates, by comparing the yearly citation impact after the prizewinning year between Nobel laureates and their prizewinning-work coauthors. Findings: We introduced the procedures to conduct a DID estimation and demonstrated the effectiveness to use matching method to improve the results. As a case study, we found that there are no significant increases in citations for Nobel laureates compared to their prizewinning coauthors. Research limitations: This study ignored the rigorous mathematical deduction parts of DID, while focused on the practical parts. Practical implications: This work gives experimental practice and potential guidelines to use DID method in science of science and bibliometrics studies. Originality/value: This study gains insights into the usage of econometric tools in science of science.  © 2023 Yurui Huang et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The identification and ranking of vital nodes in complex networks have been a critical issue for a long time. In this paper, we present an extension of existing disruptive metrics and introduce new ones, namely the disruptive coefficient (D) and 2-step disruptive coefficient (2-step D), as innovative tools for identifying critical nodes in complex networks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of disruptiveness in characterizing nodes within the network and detecting their criticality. Our new measures take into account both prior and posterior information of the focal nodes, by evaluating their ability to disrupt the previous network paradigm, setting them apart from traditional measures. We conduct an empirical analysis of four real-world networks to compare the rankings or identification of nodes using D and 2stepD with those obtained from four renowned benchmark measures, namely, degree, h-index, PageRank, and the CD index. Our analysis reveals significant differences between the nodes identified by D and 2stepD and those identified by the benchmark measures. We also examine the correlation coefficient and efficiency of the metrics and find that D and 2stepD have significant correlations with the CD index, but have weak correlations with the benchmark measures. Furthermore, we show that D and 2stepD outperform CD index and random ways in intentional attacks. We find power law distributions for D, 2stepD, and CD, indicating a small number of highly disruptive nodes and a large number of less disruptive nodes in the networks. Our results suggest that D and 2stepD are capable of providing valuable and distinct insights for identifying critical nodes in complex networks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {It is a matter of debate whether a shrinking proportion of scholarly literature is getting most of the citations over time. It is also less well understood how a narrowing use of literature would affect the circulation of ideas in the sciences. Here, I show that the utilization of scientific literature follows dual tendencies over time: while a larger proportion of literature is cited at least a few times, citations are also concentrated more at the top of the citation distribution. Parallel to the latter trend, a paper’s future importance increasingly depends on its past citation performance. A random network model shows that the citation concentration is directly related to the greater stability of citation performance. The presented evidence suggests that the growing heterogeneity of citation impact restricts the mobility of research articles that do not gain attention early on. While concentration grows from the beginning of the studied period in 1970, citation dispersion manifests itself significantly only from the mid-1990s, when the popularity of freshly published papers also increased. Most likely, advanced information technologies to disseminate papers are behind both of these latter trends. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).},

Here, we quantify the amount and type of attention 3,851 retracted papers received over time in different online platforms. Comparingwith a set of nonretracted control papers fromthe same journals with similar publication year, number of coauthors, and author impact, we show that retracted papers receive more attention after publication not only on social media but also, on heavily curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge repositories, amplifying the negative impact on the public. At the same time, we find that posts on Twitter tend to express more criticism about retracted than about control papers, suggesting that criticism-expressing tweets could contain factual information about problematic papers.Most importantly, around the time they are retracted, papers generate discussions that are primarily about the retraction incident rather than about research findings, showing that by this point, papers have exhausted attention to their results and highlighting the limited effect of retractions. Our findings reveal the extent to which retracted papers are discussed on different online platforms and identify at scale audience criticism toward them. In this context, we show that retraction is not an effective tool to reduce online attention to problematic papers.  © 2022 the Author(s).},

Acknowledging the latter’s importance, most countries make it part of their internationalization policies. With development demands to further science capacities, and global problems becoming more complex, the science–foreign policy nexus has deepened in its conceptual and practical approaches, giving rise to the evolving concept and prominence of science diplomacy. Though science has been “used for years for international relations purposes around the world, science diplomacy has become a new term for an old concept”, today it is a key tool to promote closer relations between nations, define common global goals, and as support to the internationalization of science and foreign policies. With the COVID-19 crisis, science diplomacy has gained renewed importance and calls for new approaches like the further development of “science of science diplomacy” or the inclusion of new policy support tools such as foresight. Developing countries formulating their science and foreign policies can benefit from an overview of internationalization, scientific collaboration, the existing science diplomacy concepts and practices, and the development of new approaches contributing to a better understanding of the science–foreign policy nexus. © 2023, The Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-Aligned and Other Developing Countries.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore if elite scientists play a key role in the genesis of transformative research. As there exist different types of transformative research, this paper focuses on one type of work, i.e. under-cited influential work,referred to as “sparking” articles. A comparative study between the h-indices of authors citing Nobel Prize-winning papers of sparking type and those of authors citing ordinary ones is conducted, focusing on the first author and the corresponding author of each paper. The results show that the citers of the Top 1% or Top 10% Citations Sets in the sparking group have much higher h-indices than those in the ordinary group. These findings imply that elite scientists, operationalized as those with a high h-index in the corresponding fields, are more sensitive to sparking work and, as such play a pivotal role in the genesis of transformative research.

	abstract = {The emerging field known as the “science of science” uses a variety of quantitative techniques to (among other things) understand how a specific field changes over time. The tools of network science were used to quantify the extent to which Psychology is multidisciplinary, and how the extent to which it is multidisciplinary changed over time. Citation networks were created from all of the articles published in journals identified by the Web of Science as Multidisciplinary-Psychology for each year from 2008 to 2018. Nodes in the networks represented Multidisciplinary-Psychology journals, and connections were placed to other journals (i.e., nodes) that were cited in the Multidisciplinary-Psychology articles for each year. The citation networks showed that about 25% of the citations were to other Multidisciplinary-Psychology journals, about 50% of the citations were to Psychology journals in other sub-fields, and about 25% of the citations were to journals in other disciplines. This distribution of citations remained fairly consistent across the years examined. To identify the ways in which Psychology is multidisciplinary, clusters of nodes (known as modules) in each citation network were detected to identify possible research themes that were examined further with co-word networks made from the author-provided keywords in each of the Multidisciplinary-Psychology articles that appeared in each Module. Some research topics persisted in the years examined, whereas other topics were more transient. Given that multidisciplinary research did not increase over time but instead changed in areas of research focus, ways for academic and research administrators to foster and continually renew multidisciplinary research are discussed. The discussion also describes how individual researchers might use the techniques here to identify areas of research that are less commonly explored and may prove to be fruitful areas to shift their research focus. The same techniques can be used to provide insight in to other disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Power dynamics influence every aspect of scientific collaboration. Team power dynamics can be measured by team power level and team power hierarchy. Team power level is conceptualized as the average level of the possession of resources, expertise, or decision-making authorities of a team. Team power hierarchy represents the vertical differences of the possessions of resources in a team. In Science of Science, few studies have looked at scientific collaboration from the perspective of team power dynamics. This research examines how team power dynamics affect team impact to fill the research gap. In this research, all coauthors of one publication are treated as one team. Team power level and team power hierarchy of one team are measured by the mean and Gini index of career age of coauthors in this team. Team impact is quantified by citations of a paper authored by this team. By analyzing over 7.7 million teams from Science (e.g., Computer Science, Physics), Social Sciences (e.g., Sociology, Library & Information Science), and Arts & Humanities (e.g., Art), we find that flat team structure is associated with higher team impact, especially when teams have high team power level. These findings have been repeated in all five disciplines except Art, and are consistent in various types of teams from Computer Science including teams from industry or academia, teams with different gender groups, teams with geographical contrast, and teams with distinct size. © 2022 Association for Information Science and Technology.},

This would seem to describe the ideal of the scientific process - each cohort of papers in a field surfacing the best innovations, refining them and passing on to the next "layer"or cohort of scientific works. Here, we use academic journal databases to explore this "forking"(branching) process in the evolution of a scientific paradigm. We apply citation network visualization and Latent Dirichlet allocation topic analysis to three different paradigms defined pragmatically as the set of papers citing a highly influential paper in each respective case. Our three case studies indicate a founder effect in how the seminal paper is highly-embedded in the citation network, and yet peripheral to the evolution of topics in subsequent "layers"of publications within the paradigm. This and additional evidence suggest certain topics are selected and followed, while others are left behind. From these case studies, we discuss how hitherto undeveloped ideas of the past might be located in the topic space of seminal works of the same fruitful time period.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

In this article, we applied topic modeling and word co-occurrence analysis methods to identify key topics from more than 36,000 big data publications across all academic disciplines between 2012 and 2017. The results revealed several topics associated with the storage, collection and analysis of large datasets; the publications were predominantly published in computational fields. Other identified research topics show the influence of big data methods and techniques in areas beyond computer science, such as education, urban informatics, business, health and medical sciences. In fact, the prevalence of these topics has increased over time. In contrast, some themes like parallel computing, network modeling and big data analytic techniques have lost their popularity in recent years. These results probably reflect the maturity of big data core topics and highlight flourishing new research trends pertinent to big data in new domains, especially in social sciences, health and medicine. Findings of this article can be beneficial for researchers and science policymakers to understand the scope and structure of big data in different academic disciplines. © The Author(s) 2020.},

One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper. Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find, again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar research. Taken together, these findings highlight significant challenges facing non-White scientists.  © 2023 the Author(s).},

	abstract = {The regional capability of performing front-running research and technological development has been identified as a necessary condition for future wealth creation. The quality and amount of scientific capabilities in specific fields vary dramatically across different world regions. Capabilities, knowledge, and skills are embodied by scientists working in research institutions or companies. The conditions for the emergence of a leading regional scientific environment – and the resulting early technological leadership – are poorly understood. The existence of a critical mass – the threshold above which a region can build comparably strong scientific capabilities – of scientists is often assumed. Using a unique dataset of global scientific activity and researcher mobility over several decades, we present empirical evidence in three scientific areas (semiconductor research, embryonic stem cells, and Internet research) that the process of scientific knowledge accumulation is remarkably general and applies to practically all regions. Regional knowledge accumulation data obtained from an analysis of scientists’ geolocated trajectories follow a preferential attachment mechanism characterized by a sub-linear kernel with a robust growth exponent. Scale-free growth patterns suggest that regions that move early into new technologies tend to dominate the corresponding scientific fields. We find no evidence that critical mass is required to achieve prolonged scientific dominance. We propose a simple preferential attachment model that explains the empirical data and allows us to understand deviations from the growth exponent as focused interventions to strategically attract scientists at regional level. We demonstrate this explicitly for China in the three scientific fields examined. © 2022},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of paper and author citations is of paramount importance for the design of research policies and evaluation criteria that can promote and accelerate scientific discoveries. Recently many studies on the evolution of science have been conducted in the context of the emergent Science of Science field. While many studies have probed the link problem in citation networks, only a few works have analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction in author citation networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10 well-known local network similarity measurements with four machine learning models to predict future links in author citations networks. Differently from traditional link prediction methods, the temporal nature of the predict links is relevant for our approach. Our analysis revealed that the Jaccard coefficient was found to be among the most relevant measurements. The preferential attachment measurement, conversely, displayed the worst performance. We also found that the extension of local measurements to their weighted version do not significantly improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we also found that a XGBoost and neural network approach summarizing the information from all 10 considered similarity measurements was able to provide the highest AUC performance and competitive precision values. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {With teams growing in all areas of scientific and scholarly research, we explore the relationship between team structure and the character of knowledge they produce. Drawing on 89,575 self-reports of team member research activity underlying scientific publications, we show how individual activities cohere into broad roles of 1) leadership through the direction and presentation of research and 2) support through data collection, analysis, and discussion. The hidden hierarchy of a scientific team is characterized by its lead (or L) ratio of members playing leadership roles to total team size. The L ratio is validated through correlation with imputed contributions to the specific paper and to science as a whole, which we use to effectively extrapolate the L ratio for 16,397,750 papers where roles are not explicit. We find that, relative to flat, egalitarian teams, tall, hierarchical teams produce less novelty and more often develop existing ideas, increase productivity for those on top and decrease it for those beneath, and increase short-term citations but decrease long-term influence. These effects hold within person—the same person on the same-sized team produces science much more likely to disruptively innovate if they work on a flat, high-L-ratio team. These results suggest the critical role flat teams play for sustainable scientific advance and the training and advancement of scientists. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).},

We annotate over 1.5 k papers from NLP and ML to train a SciBERT-based model to automatically predict the stance of a paper based on its title and abstract. We then analyse large-scale trends on over 41 k papers from the last approximately 35 years in NLP and ML, finding that papers have become substantially more positive over time, but negative papers also got more negative and we observe considerably more negative papers in recent years. Negative papers are also more influential in terms of citations they receive.  © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {To provide early career scientists with professional development related to science communication, we developed a full day workshop funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) entitled Developing the Science of Science Communication. This workshop has been funded since 2019 by NSF and presented in both virtual and in-person formats. Because of the success of the virtual 2021 workshop and building upon foundations from prior years (in-person in February 2019 and February 2020), a second virtual workshop was held in conjunction with the Ocean Sciences Meeting in January 2022. 2022 workshop attendees voluntarily participated in a full day virtual workshop comprised of verbal and visual communication skill sessions. In previous years, attendance was capped at 50 participants. In 2022, only 17 participants completed the pre-workshop survey. The all-day workshop included two presentation skills-focused sessions and two poster design sessions. Participants overwhelmingly agreed that they (a) would recommend the workshop to others and (b) found the workshop content would be useful in their careers. The low attendance in 2022 is believed to be due to the virtual format combined with the timing of the workshop. In years prior, the workshop was held the day before the conference. This year, we attempted to hold the workshop 1 month prior to the conference to help students prepare in advance—we think most students simply had not prepared their presentations this far in advance. NSF has already funded an exciting future workshop structure for 2023. The workshop will be held across 2 days with a virtual “pre-workshop” day for those who are ready and would like extra time and materials along with a second, in-person workshop the day prior to the conference in Palma de Mallorca, Spain in conjunction with the June 2023 Aquatic Sciences Meeting. © 2022 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.},

In this paper, we present the latest version of the CSO Classifier (v3.0), an unsupervised approach for automatically classifying research papers according to the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a comprehensive taxonomy of research areas in the field of Computer Science. The CSO Classifier takes as input the textual components of a research paper (usually title, abstract, and keywords) and returns a set of research topics drawn from the ontology. This new version includes a new component for discarding outlier topics and offers improved scalability. We evaluated the CSO Classifier on a gold standard of manually annotated articles, demonstrating a significant improvement over alternative methods. We also present an overview of applications adopting the CSO Classifier and describe how it can be adapted to other fields. © 2021, The Author(s).},

A non-linear relationship is shown in all the five indicators; specifically, we observe two types of patterns, namely inverted-L and -U relations, both presenting the existence of critical points. We further explore the discipline-level differences of such a relationship and how it relates to the characteristics of the discipline itself. Among all five indicators, the effect of disciplinary academic "environments" is universally identified.

Articles mentioned by the Nobel Prize committee in Physiology or Medicine (in short: NP articles) awarded during the period from 1900 to 2016 are the focus of our research. These articles are compared with those in a dataset of articles that do not include a Nobel Prize winner among their authors. Moreover, these non-NPs articles were not only published in the same year and in the same research field as the NP ones but were also dealing with the same research topic (such articles are referred to as non-NP articles). The results suggest that the topic-related knowledge included in Nobel Prize winning work is higher than that in non-NPs, hence with lower interdisciplinarity than the latter.

The Italian scientific production regarding the COVID-19 throughout the first months of the health emergency could help to understand the heft of female researchers in this unique period. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the gender gap in the scientific production on COVID-19 in Italy during the first months of the pandemic. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted and, for each included study, first and last author's gender, type of study, number of co-authors, type of affiliation, journal's Impact Factor (IF) and specialization were extracted. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. Results: 22.2% of the articles were signed by a woman as first author, 18.1% as last authors. Female authorship was less frequent than male authorship regardless of the type of study, number of co-authors, type of affiliation and field of specialization. Conclusion: This analysis reveal a low prevalence of studies with a female first or last author and suggests that the low share of female authors publishing on COVID-19 during the considered timespan is a transversal issue throughout the Italian medical field.

	abstract = {Academic mobility has accelerated in part due to recent civil rights movements and higher levels of social mobility. This trend increases the threat of brain drain from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which already face significant logistical challenges despite broad success in the advancement of Black professionals. We aim to examine this threat from a Science of Science perspective by collecting diachronic data for a large-scale longitudinal analysis of HBCU faculty’s academic mobility. Our study uses Memento, manual collection, and web scraping to aggregate historical identifiers (URI-Ms) of webpages from 35 HBCUs across multiple web archives. We are thus able to extend the use of “canonicalization” to associate past versions of webpages that resided at different URIs with their current URI allowing for a more accurate view of the pages over time. In this paper we define and execute a novel data collection method which is essential for our examination of HBCU human capital changes and supports a movement towards a more equitable academic workforce.

	abstract = {The science of science has attracted growing research interests, partly due to the increasing availability of large-scale datasets capturing the innerworkings of science. These datasets, and the numerous linkages among them, enable researchers to ask a range of fascinating questions about how science works and where innovation occurs. Yet as datasets grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to track available sources and linkages across datasets. Here we present SciSciNet, a large-scale open data lake for the science of science research, covering over 134M scientific publications and millions of external linkages to funding and public uses. We offer detailed documentation of pre-processing steps and analytical choices in constructing the data lake. We further supplement the data lake by computing frequently used measures in the literature, illustrating how researchers may contribute collectively to enriching the data lake. Overall, this data lake serves as an initial but useful resource for the field, by lowering the barrier to entry, reducing duplication of efforts in data processing and measurements, improving the robustness and replicability of empirical claims, and broadening the diversity and representation of ideas in the field. © 2023, The Author(s).},

We focus, in particular, on how this adoption of novel forms of evidence impacts corpus design and interpretation (which we tie to matters of casing), theoretical elaboration (which we associate to moving empirical claims across scales and empirical domains), and verification (which we see as a process of reflexive scaffolding of theoretical claims). We provide an example of the use of this framework through a study of the marketization of social scientific knowledge in the United Kingdom. © The Author(s) 2022.},

In this paper, we focus on the association between collaboration networks and scientists producing novel and disruptive research, based on the publication data from the American Physical Society. In particular, we focus on the role of spanning structural holes on producing novel and disruptive research. Our primary finding is that scientists whose collaboration networks span over structural holes in their collaboration networks not only produce more novel and disruptive research, but also have higher chance to produce novel and disruptive research. Although both male and female scientists benefit from structural holes, we find suggestive evidence that female researchers benefit more. This paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between structural holes and novel/disruptive research in the field of physics, which has policy implications for nurturing scientists and developing science policies. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {The ways in which we collect health and social data, particularly data on vulnerable and underprivileged populations, is enormously influential over the quality and content of science and health communication. Data absenteeism—the absence or limits of data on groups experiencing social vulnerability—is endemic; and as a result, inferences drawn from studies with absentee data are questionable. Reasons for data absenteeism include tendencies toward conventional recruitment of the subjects in research, the ways in which communities are engaged or not engaged in the research process, and a lack of understanding and appreciation of the lived reality of the socially vulnerable. The “hardly reached” are often labelled “hard to reach,” keeping this critical population out of view. One approach to mitigate data absenteeism is to engage key stakeholders of the community and its residents in the entire research process from design to dissemination, which influences how research questions are asked and answered and how research gets used. We argue for a more inclusive science of science communication to promote diversity and equity. © 2022 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.},

	abstract = {National governments spend significant amounts of money supporting public research. However, in an era where the international economic climate has led to budget cuts, policymakers increasingly are looking to justify the returns from public investments, including in science and innovation. The so-called ‘impact agenda’ which has emerged in many countries around the world is part of this response; an attempt to understand and articulate for the public what benefits arise from the research that is funded. The United Kingdom is the most progressed in implementing this agenda and in 2014 the national research assessment exercise, the Research Excellence Framework, for the first time included the assessment of research impact as a component. For the first time within a dual funding system, funding would be awarded not only on the basis of the academic quality of research, but also on the wider impacts of that research. In this paper we outline the context and approach taken by the UK government, along with some of the core challenges that exist in implementing such an exercise. We then synthesise, together for the first time, the results of the only two national evaluations of the exercise and offer reflections for future exercises both in the UK and internationally. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Sustainable tourism (ST) has been a buzzword in the tourism industry globally. In the Indian context, the theme has been rigorously researched, uncovering various theoretical and practical aspects. However, the strategists find themselves overwhelmed with the recommendations of researchers, which limit their efficiency in formulating plans. The study aimed to map the evolution of research on sustainable tourism in India and suggested future research actions and practical implications for managers. Methodology: The study applied SPAR-4-SLR, a scientific research protocol, to identify the 56 articles published in the Web of Science (WoS)-indexed journals. The study then used Science of Science (Sci2) and Gephi to conduct descriptive and network analyses, such as bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrences, and co-authorship analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that ST research in India revolved around managing the impact of tourism on the environment, developing economic avenues for sustainable tourism, balancing environment conservation and development, and understanding communities’ perceptions and eco-tourism. The results further highlighted a lack of empirical research linking SDG attainment to tourism sustainability. Practical Implications: The study will help researchers focus more on identifying the interlinkages between the SDGs that could be attained through sustainable tourism. Industry practitioners could benefit by identifying the knowledge gap in the theory and practice of effective strategy development. Originality: The study is one of a kind in using bibliometrics to study the themes in ST research in India and suggests future research areas post-pandemic that would assist researchers and policymakers. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

	abstract = {Background: While specialization plays an essential role in how scientific research is pursued, we understand little about its effects on a researcher’s impact and career. In particular, the extent to which one specializes within their chosen fields likely has complex relationships with productivity, career stage, and eventual impact. Here, we develop a novel and fine-grained approach for measuring a researcher’s level of specialization at each point in their career and apply it to the publication data of almost 30,000 established biomedical researchers to measure the effect that specialization has on the impact of a researcher’s publications. Results: Using a within-researcher, panel-based econometric framework, we arrive at several important results. First, there are significant scientific rewards for specialization—25% more citations per standard deviation increase in specialization. Second, these benefits are much higher early in a researcher’s career—as large as 75% per standard deviation increase in specialization. Third, rewards are higher for researchers who publish few papers relative to their peers. Finally, we find that, all else equal, researchers who make large changes in their research direction see generally increased impact. Conclusions: The extent to which one specializes, particularly at the early stages of a biomedical research career, appears to play a significant role in determining the citation-based impact of their publications. When this measure of impact is, implicitly or explicitly, an input into decision-making processes within the scientific system (for example, for job opportunities, promotions, or invited talks), these findings lead to some important implications for the system-level organization of scientific research and the incentives that exist therein. We propose several mechanisms within modern scientific systems that likely lead to the scientific rewards we observe and discuss them within the broader context of reward structures in biomedicine and science more generally. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we aim at examining whether there is a two-way interactive effect between scientific instruments (si) and scientific publications (sp) by employing the Granger Causality Test. As scientists explore the world, and indeed the universe, more and more deeply, new demands are constantly made for innovations in scientific instruments. More advanced scientific instruments, in turn, promote greater advances in the underlying science. Although the relationship between developments in scientific instruments and advances in science is intuitive, it has not been estimated statistically. Gaining a better empirical understanding of this relationship is, therefore, important to the science of science. Previous studies have not revealed whether there is a measurable interactive effect between them. To fill this gap in the research, we collected 42 years of data on the number of global scientific instrument patents and 42 years of data on the number of scientific research papers, both during the period 1980–2021. We take the logs of these counts (lnsi and lnsp) and perform time-series analyses of the two data sets. The Granger Causality Test is then employed to ascertain whether there exists an observable mutual association between the two time-series. The Granger Causality Test reveals, with a very high degree of confidence, a mutual predictive relationship between them. Stated differently, each time-series appears to “forecast” the other, with different time lags. A number of the Granger Causality Tests based on the characteristics of si/ sp disclose that the interaction between si and sp also applies to the mutual effect between the characteristics of si and sp, with different lag lengths. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

I first describe the main characteristics of the peer review literature, which focuses mainly on journal and grant peer review. Based on these characteristics, I then argue why theory is useful in research on peer review, and I present some theoretical efforts on peer review. I conclude by encouraging peer review researchers to be more theoretically engaged and outline activities that theoretical work on peer review could involve. This invitation to theory-building complements recent roadmaps and calls that have emphasized that we need to have better access to peer review data, improve research design and statistical analysis in peer review studies, experiment with innovative approaches to peer review, and provide more funding for peer review research. © 2022 Sven E.

	abstract = {AIM: To assess the efficacy of ketotifen in treating allergic conjunctivitis. METHODS: A systematic search of systematic reviews and Meta-analyses was conducted on the PubMed and Web Science of Science until October 2021 to address this knowledge gap. Mean difference with 95%CI and P values were used to assess the efficacy of ketotifen. The heterogeneity (I2) was used to evaluate the impact of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1589 patients were included in this Meta-analysis. The results revealed that after treating with ketotifen, itching (MD=-0.91, 95%CI: -1.63 to -0.20, I2=94%, P=0.01), tearing (MD=-0.40, 95%CI: -0.61 to -0.18, I2=75%, P=0.0003) and total signs and symptoms (MD=-0.85, 95%CI: -1.12 to -0.58, I2=0, P<0.00001) showed better benefit effect compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Topical ketotifen is an effective treatment for patients with allergic conjunctivitis. © 2023 International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office). All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the Web of Science (WoS) database to identify the 124 articles published in the theme. The study uses bibliometric indicators such as the co-citation network, word co-occurrence network to analyze the publication and citation structure using Science of Science (Sci2), OpenRefine, and Gephi. Findings: The top authors, top journals and major themes are recognized using bibliometric techniques. The study identifies six keyword clusters: entrepreneurship, innovation, and empirical collaborating with tourism, hospitality, and family business. The country-wise collaboration indicates the lack of research in the eastern hemisphere of the world. The co-authorship shows studies shared among individuals of a few organizations. The trends from bibliographic coupling depict the evolution of research. Research limitations/implications: The scope of data collection for the network analysis is limited to the WoS. Incorporating papers from other databases might provide different network structures and insights. Originality/value: The study is the first of its kind in the theme of family businesses in tourism and hospitality and will contribute to the literature by identifying future research directions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This book addresses the concern expressed by Pentagon Leaders that government resources would be better spent if we restricted the support of research to the top universities to the exclusion of all others. Establishing the veracity of this assertion sounds like a straightforward task, but it is not, with the devil being in the details. In the present case the details reside in the inverse power law (IPL) statistics of the datasets used to construct the measures of research value associated with the three major funding strategies used by the Army Research Office (ARO) to support basic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research. The statistics of research value in terms of the number of papers published and citations made to those papers are both IPL distributions, which makes the construction and interpretation of viable measures of research quality problematic. Thus, most of the book is devoted to interpretations of the various measures entailed by IPL statistics, but not with the mathematical details, which are amply referenced. An in-depth study of the funding by ARO addressing this question was concluded prior to Dr. West's retirement from ARO in July of 2021. The major conclusion drawn from the study was that if the budget of the ARO single individual funding was cut in half and invested instead in block grants to top universities, the result would by a disproportionate loss of research value to ARO and to the U.S. Army. The book reviews the measures constructed on which this conclusion was reached and the consistency of this conclusion with the discussion of Science of Science carried out by the broader science community. © 2023 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this work we identify factors related to a scientist’s collaboration capacity, their ability accumulate new collaborations over their career. To do this offer a new collaboration capacity framework and begin the work of validating it empirically by testing a number of hypotheses. We use data from GenBank, a cyberinfrastructure (CI)-enabled data repository that stores and manages scientific data. The data allow us to construct longitudinal networks, thereby giving us yearly scientific collaboration maps. We find that a scientist’s network position at an early stage is related to their capacity to build new collaborations and that researchers who manage an upward trend in productivity tend to have higher collaboration capacity. Our work makes a contribution to science of science studies by offering a collaboration capacity framework and providing partial empirical support for it.

At the same time, funding and institutional arrangements, as well as scientific and political cultures, affect the structure of collaboration networks.

To test this, we compare the structure of collaboration networks among prominent researchers in North America and Europe. We find that prominent researchers in Europe establish denser collaboration networks, whereas those in North America establish more decentralized networks. We also find that the impact of the publications of prominent researchers in North America is significantly higher than for those in Europe, both when they collaborate with other prominent researchers and when they do not. Although Europeans collaborate with other prominent researchers more often, which increases their impact, we also find that repeated collaboration among prominent researchers decreases the synergistic effect of collaborating. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Science and technology transform the frontiers of knowledge and have deep and powerful impacts on society, demonstrating how social reality varies with each era of the world. As a set of fictional representations of technologically driven future worlds, the Metaverse is increasingly shaping the socio-technical imaginaries of data-driven smart cities, i.e., the outcome of radical transformations of dominant structures, processes, practices, and cultures. At the core of the systematic exploration of science and technology is the relationships between scientific knowledge, technological systems, and values and ethics from a wide range of perspectives. Positioned within science of science, this study investigates the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form of science and technology and the wider social context in which it is embedded. Therefore, it adopts an analytical and philosophical framework of STS, and in doing so, it employs an integrated approach to discourse analysis, supported by a comparative analysis of the Metaverse and Ambient Intelligence. This study shows that the Metaverse as a scientific and technological activity is socially constructed, politically driven, economically conditioned, and historically situated. That is, it is inherently human and hence value-laden, as well as can only be understood as contextualized within the socio-political-economic-historical framework that gives rise to it, sustains it, and makes it durable by material effects and networks. This view in turn corroborates that the Metaverse raises serious concerns as to determinism, social exclusion, marginalization, privacy erosion, surveillance, control, democratic backsliding, hive mentality, cyber-utopianism, and dystopianism. This study argues that, due to the problematic nature of the Metaverse in terms of its inherent ethical and social implications, there need to be more explicit processes and practices for enhancing public participation and allowing a more democratic public role in its shaping and control, especially early in the decision-making process of its development—when the opportunity for effective inputs and informed choices is greatest. The novelty of this study lies in that it is the first of its kind with respect to probing the link between the Metaverse and data-driven smart cities from an STS perspective. The main contribution of this study lies in deepening and extending social scientific critiques and understandings of the imaginaries of data-driven smart cities based on the analysis and evaluation of the Metaverse and the warning signals and troubling visions it conveys and animates in order to help construct desirable alternative futures for the greater good of all citizens. The ultimate goal is to structure the Metaverse in ways that are morally acceptable and collectively the most democratically beneficial for society. © 2022 by the author.},

The main purpose of our study is to understand the behavior of the publications citing one retracted article and the characteristics of the citations the retracted article accumulated over time. Our analysis is based on a methodology which illustrates how we gathered the data, extracted the topics of the citing articles and visualized the results. The data and services used are all open and free to foster the reproducibility of the analysis. The outcomes concerned the analysis of the entities citing Wakefield et al.’s article and their related in-text citations. We observed a constant increasing number of citations in the last 20 years, accompanied with a constant increment in the percentage of those acknowledging its retraction. Citing articles have started either discussing or dealing with the retraction of Wakefield et al.’s article even before its full retraction happened in 2010. Articles in the social sciences domain citing the Wakefield et al.’s one were among those that have mostly discussed its retraction. In addition, when observing the in-text citations, we noticed that a large number of the citations received by Wakefield et al.’s article has focused on general discussions without recalling strictly medical details, especially after the full retraction. Medical studies did not hesitate in acknowledging the retraction of the Wakefield et al.’s article and often provided strong negative statements on it. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Although they received only 40 points, they did not have fewer bibliometric achievements than Polish historical journals rated at 100 points. A comparison of bibliometric achievements of 18 Polish history journals indexed in Scopus showed that in 2019 and 2020, the journal Studia Historiae Scientiarum had the highest values of these indicators. On this basis, it is justified to claim that in the case of Polish journals in the discipline of “history” and sub-disciplines “history of science” and “history and philosophy of science”, the ministerial list of journals was built on the basis of non-objective and non-transparent rules. Such a critical remark also applies to the previous lists of journals of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland, including the list of December 18, 2019. It is therefore necessary to: a) thoroughly improve the scores of Polish journals in the sub-disciplines “history of science” and “history and philosophy of science” in the short term, because maintaining such verdicts will lead to an unjustified depreciation of scientific achievements in the field of these sub-disciplines during the evaluation of Polish academic units, and b) develop a new Polish model for evaluating journals in the long term. Bearing in mind the achievements of the integrated science of science, in particular the method of correspondence thinking and the idea of scientific (r)evolution by Michał Kokowski, praxeological research in the spirit of Tadeusz Kotarbiński, scientific communication and the trend named the responsible metrics, a new model of journal evaluation is presented. The idea of objective measures of journal’s achievements and the costs of publishing in it are described: the journal’s achievement measure (JAM)©, the journal’s cost-effectiveness measure (JCEM)© and the normalized journal’s cost-effectiveness measure (NJCEM)©. This is followed by a presentation of Rules for the creation of lists of scientific journals according to the Unit for the Science of Science at the Institute for the History of Science (Polish Academy of Sciences)©. It is postulated that relevant appreciation of editorial and review activity in the Polish system of evaluation of scientific achievements should be introduced by modifying the current regulation on the evaluation of scientific achievements. © 2021, Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences,Commission on the History of Science.

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of scientific impact is important for scientists, academic recommender systems, and granting organizations alike. Existing approaches rely on many years of leading citation values to predict a scientific paper's citations (a proxy for impact), even though most papers make their largest contributions in the first few years after they are published. In this paper, we tackle a new problem: predicting a new paper's citation time series from the date of publication (i.e., without leading values). We propose HINTS, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that converts citation signals from dynamic heterogeneous information networks (DHIN) into citation time series. HINTS imputes pseudo-leading values for a paper in the years before it is published from DHIN embeddings, and then transforms these embeddings into the parameters of a formal model that can predict citation counts immediately after publication. Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets from Computer Science and Physics show that HINTS is competitive with baseline citation prediction models. While we focus on citations, our approach generalizes to other "cold start"time series prediction tasks where relational data is available and accurate prediction in early timestamps is crucial.

Developers of these platforms often advocate for open science on the grounds that it is in keeping with scientific values, specifically referencing Mertonian norms. However, many scientists are agnostic toward open science; as policies and technology enforce the movement's aims of sharing openly, they seek to protect the research they view as their own. My dissertation work studies the enactment of open science by a variety of stakeholders in the Open Science Framework (OSF) - its developers, its users, and also its non-users. Through interviews, trace data collection, and observation of these various populations, I will explore how these stakeholders construct different technologies-in-practice. By taking the OSF not as a given, but as a technology whose purpose and effects are structured by the constraints and resources of its stakeholders, I will unpack the tensions among open science advocates, agnostics, and their use of technology. With these insights, science policy and open systems can be designed to better accommodate the diverse concerns of stakeholders. © 2021 ACM.},

This modular graph was then studied from several perspectives, taking into account topological measurements as well as time evolution. A number of interesting results are reported, including a good level of thematic coherence within each identified area, as well as the identification of distinct periods over time including the onset and coming of age of bipolar junction technology and related areas.

Here, we use the SIR epidemic model as a mechanistic model for the citation dynamics of well-cited papers published in selected journals of the American Physical Society. The estimated epidemiological parameters offer insight into unknown quantities as the size of the community that could cite a paper and its ultimate impact on that community. We find a good, though imperfect, agreement between the rank of the journals obtained using the epidemiological parameters and the impact factor rank.

	abstract = {Growth of science is a prevalent issue in science of science studies. In recent years, two new bibliographic databases have been introduced, which can be used to study growth processes in science from centuries back: Dimensions from Digital Science and Microsoft Academic. In this study, we used publication data from these new databases and added publication data from two established databases (Web of Science from Clarivate Analytics and Scopus from Elsevier) to investigate scientific growth processes from the beginning of the modern science system until today. We estimated regression models that included simultaneously the publication counts from the four databases. The results of the unrestricted growth of science calculations show that the overall growth rate amounts to 4.10% with a doubling time of 17.3 years. As the comparison of various segmented regression models in the current study revealed, models with four or five segments fit the publication data best. We demonstrated that these segments with different growth rates can be interpreted very well, since they are related to either phases of economic (e.g., industrialization) and/or political developments (e.g., Second World War). In this study, we additionally analyzed scientific growth in two broad fields (Physical and Technical Sciences as well as Life Sciences) and the relationship of scientific and economic growth in UK. The comparison between the two fields revealed only slight differences. The comparison of the British economic and scientific growth rates showed that the economic growth rate is slightly lower than the scientific growth rate. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article, for which the focus is an intellectual autobiography, examines the development of worldview of a young person who graduated from the Moscow University Faculty of Philosophy in 1970. It highlights the main socially significant events of those times, events that determined the formation of the sociopolitical views of youth who did not accept Soviet ideology. It presents the reading circles and interactions of that period and tells of the outstanding Russian philosophers of the 1960s–1970s under whose influence this professional development took place. It considers the main topics of the key scholarship in philosophy, as well as the dynamics of research interests and problems. Particular attention is paid to the story of the originality of work by the Moscow Methodological Circle, led by Georgy P. Shchedrovitsky. The circle’s main task was to put all acts of reasoning and mental operations—naming, defining, describing, building ontological models and theoretical constructions, and so forth—under reflexive control. This was, to some extent, reminiscent of the inquiries of Western analytical philosophy, which made it a “suspicious” activity in the ideological sense in the Soviet Union. Cognition as a whole no longer seemed a “reflection” of reality, as had been proclaimed in the leading epistemological understanding of Marxist–Leninist philosophy. However, this also reflected the desire of intellectuals of the sixties and seventies to rationalize all social life as a whole. These dreams of “rationality” manifested at the time in the development of relevant topics in disciplines such as epistemology, in philosophy and methodology of science, and in sociological and psychological research. The author tells how the discussions of methodological problems of historical reconstruction began from positions like these. The discussion of discourse on knowledge in the humanities required not only intellectual audacity but social audacity as well. These discussions took place in informal, home-based seminars and represented a marginal, “clandestine” phenomenon. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Prediction focuses on the forecasting of future performance (or impact) of an entity, either a research article or a scientist, and also the prediction of future links in collaboration networks or identifying missing links in citation networks. The single chapters are written in a way that help the reader gain a detailed technical understanding of the corresponding subjects, the strength and weaknesses of the state-of-the-art approaches for each described problem, and the currently open challenges. While chapter 1 provides a useful contribution in the theoretical foundations of the fields of scientometrics and science of science, chapters 2-4 turn the focal point to the study of factors that affect research impact and its dynamics. Chapters 5-7 then focus on article-level measures that quantify the current and future impact of scientific articles. Next, chapters 8-10 investigate subjects relevant to predicting the future impact of individual researchers. Finally, chapters 11-13 focus on science evolution and dynamics, leveraging heterogeneous and interconnected data, where the analysis of research topic trends and their evolution has always played a key role in impact prediction approaches and quantitative analyses in the field of bibliometrics. Each chapter can be read independently, since it includes a detailed description of the problem being investigated along with a thorough discussion and study of the respective state-of-the-art. Due to the cross-disciplinary character of the Science of Science field, the book may be useful to interested readers from a variety of disciplines like information science, information retrieval, network science, informetrics, scientometrics, and machine learning, to name a few.

	abstract = {Background: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. Objective: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. Methods: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. Results: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, σx=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; σx=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; σx=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; σx=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. Conclusions: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

It is a significant research topic in the field of science of science to determine the important author of the article according to the author's signature positions, such as the chaperone effect proposed in recent years. The paper analyzes the differences among authors in different positions, defines the first author, second author, third author, last author, corresponding author and penultimate author in different signature positions as the important authors of the article to detect the chaperone effect systematically. The results show the generalized chaperone effect. At the same time, the paper analyzes the change trend and the differences of the chaperone effect of authors in different positions. We explain the differences by calculating the similarity coefficient among authors in different positions and corresponding authors. When there is a high coincidence among authors in different signature positions and corresponding authors, such as the coincidence between the last authors and corresponding authors in comprehensive journals is higher, the coincidence between the first authors and corresponding authors in comprehensive journals is higher. This study can help us to understand the role and the contribution of authors in academic articles, and further develop new scientific theories based on author's signature positions.

Although usage information is hard to obtain, features from the publications that describe a dataset can provide clues. This article associates dataset downloads with the authors’ h-index, institutional prestige, journal ranking, and the references used in the publication that first introduces them. Tens of thousands of datasets and associated publications from figshare.com are used in our analysis. We found that a gradient boosting model achieved the highest performance against linear regression, random forests, and artificial neural networks. Our interpretation results suggest that journal ranking is highly predictive of usage while the author’s institutional prestige and h-index are less critical. In addition, we found that publications with a long but focused body of references are associated with more dataset downloads. We also show that prediction performance decays rapidly the farther we estimate downloads into the future.

The present study focused on a specific field of mobile phone behavior as a prototypical case to demonstrate at a microscopic level the real-world complexity of how to find leading scholars in a newly emerging and highly interdisciplinary field of research scientifically. It used a novel mixed method combining content analysis and bibliometric analysis to identify and verify leading scholars in the field effectively and efficiently. The major findings of the study include that (1) a total of 390 leading scholars in the field have been identified based on explicit recognition by 260 authors of 102 chapters of an encyclopedia of mobile phone behavior; (2) overall, peer recognition evidence of the identified 390 leading scholars and bibliometric evidence of the three indicators for verifying leader scholars are relatively consistent; (3) among the four categories of the 390 leading scholars, the dominant one is the 273 scholars who receive only one peer recognition but have strong bibliometric evidence, potentially due to the nature of either an emerging filed or an interdisciplinary field; and (4) the highest-cited citations could be considered the best bibliometric indicators for verifying leading scholars effectively and efficiently. Implications, future directions, and limitations are discussed. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

The results showed that the United States was the most productive country, followed by the United Kingdom and China. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had the largest number of publications, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Bristol. In terms of disciplines, environmental science and meteorological and atmospheric science have contributed the most. By using cluster analysis of all keywords, four key research topics of CHGs were identified and reviewed: (1) emissions calculation, (2) physicochemical analysis of halocarbons, (3) evaluation of replacements, and (4) environmental impact. The change in research substances is closely related to the phase-out schedule of the Montreal Protocol. In terms of environmental impact, global warming has always been the most important research hotspot, whereas research on ozone-depleting substances and biological toxicity shows a gradually rising trend. © 2022 by the authors.

Citation analysis is also important for analyzing scientific innovation and the structure of the biomedical literature. We wanted to facilitate citation analysis for the broad community by providing a user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing citation data for biomedical articles. Case Presentation: We seeded the Citation Cloud dataset with over 465 million open access citations culled from six different sources: PubMed Central, Microsoft Academic Graph, ArnetMiner, Semantic Scholar, Open Citations, and the NIH iCite dataset. We implemented a free, public extension to PubMed that allows any user to visualize and analyze the entire citation cloud around any paper of interest A: the set of articles cited by A, those which cite A, those which are co-cited with A, and those which are bibliographically coupled to A. Conclusions: Citation Cloud greatly enables the study of citations by the scientific community, including relatively advanced analyses (co-citations and bibliographic coupling) that cannot be undertaken using other available tools. The tool can be accessed by running any PubMed query on the Anne O’Tate value-added search interface and clicking on the Citations button next to any retrieved article. © 2022, Medical Library Association.

Analyzing and monitoring scientific conferences is thus crucial for all users who need to take informed decisions in this space. However, scholarly search engines and bibliometric applications only provide a limited set of analytics for assessing research conferences, preventing us from performing a comprehensive analysis of these events. In this paper, we introduce the AIDA Dashboard, a novel web application, developed in collaboration with Springer Nature, for analyzing and comparing scientific conferences. This tool introduces three major new features: 1) it enables users to easily compare conferences within specific fields (e.g., Digital Libraries) and time-frames (e.g., the last five years); 2) it characterises conferences according to a 14K research topics from the Computer Science Ontology (CSO); and 3) it provides several functionalities for assessing the involvement of commercial organizations, including the ability to characterize industrial contributions according to 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) from the Industrial Sectors Ontology (INDUSO). We evaluated the AIDA Dashboard by performing both a quantitative evaluation and a user study, obtaining excellent results in terms of quality of the analytics and usability.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The collection welcomes science of science studies that link basic science to disease mechanisms, as well as meta-research articles highlighting opportunities to improve transparency, rigor, and reproducibility among the types of papers published in Clinical Science. Submissions might include science of science studies that explore factors linked to successful translation, or meta-research on experimental methods or study designs that are often used in translational research.

	abstract = {Objective: Clinical trials ensure that pharmaceutical treatments are safe, efficacious, and effective for public consumption, but are extremely complex, taking up to 10 years and $2.6 billion to complete. One main source of complexity arises from the collaboration between actors, and network science methodologies can be leveraged to explore that complexity. We aim to characterize collaborations between actors in the clinical trials context and investigate trends of successful actors. Materials and Methods: We constructed a temporal network of clinical trial collaborations between large and small-size pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, hospital systems, and government agencies from public and proprietary data and introduced metrics to quantify actors' collaboration network structure, organizational behavior, and partnership characteristics. A multivariable regression analysis was conducted to determine the metrics' relationship with success. Results: We found a positive correlation between the number of successful approved trials and interdisciplinary collaborations measured by a collaboration diversity metric (P <. 01). Our results also showed a negative effect of the local clustering coefficient (P <. 01) on the success of clinical trials. Large pharmaceutical companies have the lowest local clustering coefficient and more diversity in partnerships across biomedical specializations. Conclusions: Large pharmaceutical companies are more likely to collaborate with a wider range of actors from other specialties, especially smaller industry actors who are newcomers in clinical research, resulting in exclusive access to smaller actors. Future investigations are needed to show how concentrations of influence and resources might result in diminished gains in treatment development. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Within 429,698 references cited by the 7,223 articles, 11,165 (2.6%) are paper-to-patent citations, while 418,533 (97.4%) are paper-to-paper citations. In comparison to paper-to-paper citations, paper-to-patent citations were more concentrated at the beginning of articles. Higher proportions of patents are cited in the introduction and methods sections and are only cited once. The results indicate that patents are likely to be cited for providing background knowledge.

	abstract = {Understanding the structure of knowledge domains is one of the foundational challenges in the science of science. Here, we propose a neural embedding technique that leverages the information contained in the citation network to obtain continuous vector representations of scientific periodicals. We demonstrate that our periodical embeddings encode nuanced relationships between periodicals and the complex disciplinary and interdisciplinary structure of science, allowing us to make cross-disciplinary analogies between periodicals. Furthermore, we show that the embeddings capture meaningful “axes” that encompass knowledge domains, such as an axis from “soft” to “hard” sciences or from “social” to “biological” sciences, which allow us to quantitatively ground periodicals on a given dimension. By offering novel quantification in the science of science, our framework may, in turn, facilitate the study of how knowledge is created and organized.

	abstract = {Modern science is dominated by scientific productions from teams. A recent finding shows that teams of both large and small sizes are essential in research, prompting us to analyze the extent to which a country’s scientific work is carried out by big or small teams. Here, using over 26 million publications from Web of Science, we find that China’s research output is more dominated by big teams than the rest of the world, which is particularly the case in fields of natural science. Despite the global trend that more papers are written by big teams, China’s drop in small team output is much steeper. As teams in China shift from small to large size, the team diversity that is essential for innovative work does not increase as much as that in other countries. Using the national average as the baseline, we find that the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) supports fewer small teams than the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States does, implying that big teams are preferred by grant agencies in China. Our finding provides new insights into the concern of originality and innovation in China, which indicates a need to balance small and big teams. © 2020 Linlin Liu, Jianfei Yu, Junming Huang, Feng Xia, and Tao Jia.

However, we know little about funder collaborations and the impact of collaboratively funded projects. As an initial effort towards this, we examine the co-funding network, where a funder represents a node and an edge signifies collaboration. Our core data include all papers that cite and receive citations by the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, a prominent clinical review journal. We find that 65% of clinical papers have multiple funders and discover communities of funders that are formed by national boundaries and funding objectives. To quantify success in funding, we use a g-index metric that indicates efficiency of funders in supporting clinically relevant research. After controlling for authorship, we find that funders generally achieve higher success when collaborating than when solo-funding. We also find that as a funder, seeking multiple, direct connections with various disconnected funders may be more beneficial than being part of a densely interconnected network of co-funders. The results of this paper indicate that collaborations can potentially accelerate innovation, not only among authors but also funders.  © 2021 The Authors.},

For instance, in science, the movie industry, music, and art, the occurrence of the highest impact work and a hot streak within a creative career are very difficult to predict. Are there domains that are more prone to luck than others? Here, we provide new insights on the role of randomness in impact in creative careers in two ways: (i) we systematically untangle luck and individual ability to generate impact in the movie, music, and book industries, and in science, and compare the luck factor between these fields; (ii) we show the surprising presence of randomness in the relationship between collaboration networks and timing of career hits. Taken together, our analysis suggests that luck consistently affects career impact across all considered sectors and improves our understanding in pinpointing the key elements in driving success. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines are notorious for gender imbalance favouring men. From these, Computer Science appears to among the worst. The imbalance comes despite the fact that, the proportion of women publishing impactful papers has increased over the last couple of decades. Here, we explore the potential gender differences in collaboration dynamics of leading academics in Computer Science and contrast it with other researchers in the same discipline. This work aims to demonstrate that productivity patterns differ between men and women; understanding such patterns is fundamental to improving the current situation by driving well-thought interventions. We start by looking at topological features of academics ego-networks and their variability over their career lifespan; we found that women have a higher rate of repeated collaborators, while men have slightly more new collaborators. Second, we show gender differences in the acquisition patterns and maintenance of collaborations over the researchers' careers. Third, we look at alters' gender composition and gender role in introducing new collaborations to researchers and found that women are more homophilic than men and that the gender of the person being introduced (alter) tends to match the gender of the ego (the researcher). Last, we show that women reach their highest productivity levels earlier in their careers than men, but the levels attained are not at the same magnitude as men. Our work highlights the importance of studying gender differences by productivity levels, the role of gender-mixed groups in academia and the relation to academic production within these groups. This work contributes to a better understanding of gender roles in Computer Science and points to ways that can help reduce possible gaps.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

One of the great pioneers and avant-gardes in the development of these fields can be called Derek De Solla Price. Price's descriptions of "science of science" have led to the definition of scientometrics and he is famous as the father of this field. Price was one of those first who introduced "x number of authors" as one of the indicators of scientific activities in different countries. The costly activities of scientometrics were so valuable that Tibor Brown, the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal Scientometrics, created a prize in 1983 to commemorate Price's work. This prize is the first and foremost international infometric prize awarded every two years. This chapter will cover his biography and his activities, and topics such as science of science, citation and referencing, the Price index, and his scientific growth pattern. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

	abstract = {We studied international migrations of researchers, scientists, and academics, to better understand the so-called “brain drain” phenomenon, if and how it can be measured, and how it changes over time. We discuss why some trivial measures can be ineffective, and as a consequence, we built the global scientific migration network to identify the most important countries involved in the mobility of scholars, and to study their role at a local and a global scale. For such a purpose, we analysed a temporal directed weighted network representing scientists moving from one country to another, from 2000 to 2016, built on top of 2.8 million ORCID public profiles. With the support of the well-known HITS algorithm, we found hubs and authorities to study the interplay between providing and attracting researchers from a global perspective, and its relationship to other structural features. Our findings highlight the presence of a set of countries acting both as hubs and authorities, occupying a privileged position in the Scientific Migration Network, that is network of the scientific migrations, and having similar local characteristics, i.e., several neighbours with highly differentiated flows of researchers moving from/to them. However, it is striking that some of these countries have a predominant role over the others, and that we can easily observe countries that are extremely more attractive than others, as well as other countries that perform better as exporters than importers of scientists. It is also interesting that hubs and authorities scores can change over time, alongside with their relative discrepancy, and other network measures, suggesting that local and/or global policies can buck the trend. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite the increasing interest in investigating and promoting scientific collaborations, we know little about the collaboration sustainability as well as mechanisms behind it. In this paper, we set out to study the relationships between early-stage reciprocity and collaboration sustainability. By proposing and defining h-index reciprocity, we give a comprehensive statistical analysis on how reciprocity influences scientific collaboration sustainability, and find that scholars are not altruism and the key to sustainable collaboration is fairness. The unfair h-index reciprocity has an obvious negative impact on collaboration sustainability. The bigger the reciprocity difference, the less sustainable in collaboration. This work facilitates understanding sustainable collaborations and thus will benefit both individual scholar in optimizing collaboration strategies and the whole academic society in improving teamwork efficiency.  © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.},

Secondly, the article deals with the religious-confessional and scientific aspects of theology as a branch of knowledge (a group of specialties), which is part of the family of social and human sciences.

With the growing availability of large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories, scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has emerged to be an active research domain called the Science of Science (i.e., SciSci). In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic perspective to examine how individual and social factors will influence career success over time. We propose ACSeeker, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore the potential factors of success and how the influence of multiple factors changes at different stages of academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact Analysis framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic career success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is designed to reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole population. A customized career line showing the individual career development is provided to allow a detailed inspection. To validate the effectiveness and usability of ACSeeker, we report two case studies and interviews with a social scientist and general researchers.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

This work focuses on scientific networks as a social network having different nodes and connections. Nodes can be represented by authors, articles or journals while connections by citation, co-citation or co-authorship. One of the challenges in creating scientific networks is the lack of publicly available comprehensive data set. It limits the variety of analyses on the same set of nodes of different scientific networks. To supplement such analyses we have worked on publicly available citation metadata from Crossref and OpenCitatons. Using this data a workflow is developed to create scientific networks. Analysis of these networks gives insights into academic research and scholarship. Different techniques of social network analysis have been applied in the literature to study these networks. It includes centrality analysis, community detection, and clustering coefficient. We have used metadata of Scientometrics journal, as a case study, to present our workflow. We did a sample run of the proposed workflow to identify prominent authors using centrality analysis. This work is not a bibliometric study of any field rather it presents replicable Python scripts to perform network analysis. With an increase in the popularity of open access and open metadata, we hypothesise that this workflow shall provide an avenue for understanding scientific scholarship in multiple dimensions.

	abstract = {The art and craft of science advice is not innately known by those scientists who choose to step out of the lab or the university to engage with the world of policy. Despite a wealth of literature on the ‘science of science advice’, in nearly every situation there is no ‘teacher’ of science advice; it is a typical case of learning on the job. Within that context, the learning of scholars engaging in expert advice is always situated and can sometimes be transformative. To date, however, there has been no systematic, in-depth research into expert advisers’ learning—instead focusing mostly on policymakers’ and publics’ learning about science. In this article, I suggest that such a research programme is timely and potentially a very fruitful line of inquiry for two mains reasons. First, in the case of environmental and climate issues—the focus of the paper—it has become ubiquitous to talk about the need for transformative change(s) towards sustainable futures. If scholars are going to advocate for and inform transformations beyond academia, then in doing so they ought to also take a harder look at how they themselves are transforming within. Specifically, the article illustrates how qualitative research on advisers’ learning can contribute to our understanding of how experts are adapting to changing circumstances in science–policy interactions. Second, it is argued that research on advisers’ learning can directly contribute to: (i) guidance for present and future advisers (especially early-career researchers wishing to engage with policy) and organisational learning in science–policy organisations; and (ii) improving policy-relevance of research and the design of impact evaluations for research funding (e.g. Research Excellence Framework). With the hope of stimulating (rather than closing off) innovative ideas, the article offers some ways of thinking through and carrying out such a research programme. As the nature of both science and policymaking continues to change, the learning experiences of expert advisers is a bountiful resource that has yet to be tapped into. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Due to the sheer amount of research published and the growth of ever-changing interdisciplinary areas, researchers need an efficient way to identify important scholarly work. The number of citations a given research publication has accrued has been used for this purpose, but these take time to occur and longer to accumulate. In this article, we use altmetrics to predict the short-term and long-term citations that a scholarly publication could receive. We build various classification and regression models and evaluate their performance, finding neural networks and ensemble models to perform best for these tasks. We also find that Mendeley readership is the most important factor in predicting the early citations, followed by other factors such as the academic status of the readers (e.g., student, postdoc, professor), followers on Twitter, online post length, author count, and the number of mentions on Twitter, Wikipedia, and across different countries.  © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.},

Since the number of scholars and the number of scholarly outputs grow exponentially with time, well-designed ranking metrics that have the potential to assist in these tasks are of prime importance. To rank scholars, it is important to put their achievements in perspective by comparing them with the achievements of other scholars active in the same period. We propose here a particular way of doing so: by computing the evaluated scholar's share on each year's citations which quantifies how the scholar fares in competition with the others. We assess the resulting ranking method using the American Physical Society citation data and four prestigious physics awards. Our results show that the new method significantly outperforms other ranking methods in identifying the prize laureates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.},

Especially with the rapidly evolving social media ecosystem, issues of public trust in consensus science have increasingly concerned those professionals whose mission it is to convey truthful and credible information. For several years, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have been studying the “Science of Science Communication” and other aspects of public credulity in scientific findings, and recently, the National Academy of Medicine published a discussion article proposing strategies for combatting the spread of health misinformation-including the creation of source-vetting guidance to be enacted by the major social media platforms. In the present article, the authors, who for years have explored issues around public trust and new media communication of science, explore the Academy's proposals and offer their own guidance on reconciling public perceptions with “authoritative” health and other science communications. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	abstract = {Inspired by the concept of “potential energy” in physics, we propose a new indicator to measure the “direction” of interdisciplinary knowledge diffusion named “disciplinary potential energy” (DPE). We also used the Shannon entropy to measure the “diversity” of interdisciplinary knowledge diffusion. In memory of Professor Zeyuan Liu, a pioneer in the field of science of science (SoS) in China, we measured the direction and diversity of his interdisciplinary knowledge diffusion, based on his 371 publications and subsequent citations in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and 236 journal articles and subsequent citations in the Chinese Social Science Citation Index (CSSCI) database, respectively. The findings are (1) the newly proposed indicator that has advantages over previous interdisciplinary indicators characterizing the relative location of each discipline in the knowledge flow, through both direct and indirect citations; (2) particular importance was attached to Liu's contributions to management science (focusing on SoS) and philosophy (focusing on philosophy of science and technology) because of the “reverse-flow” of his knowledge from “net-inflow” disciplines to “net-outflow” disciplines, although his contributions covered at least four disciplines, namely management science, economics (focusing on technical economics), philosophy, and engineering; and (3) Liu's research has had ever-increasing influence on management science over the past decade, while his interdisciplinary citation influence decreased in economics, philosophy and engineering. This study not only demonstrates how extensive Liu's knowledge contributions have been to Chinese academia. We also shed light on the methodology to measure interdisciplinary knowledge diffusion. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Understanding about nature of science is important topic in science education as well as in pre-service science teacher education. In science education, Nature of Science (NOS), in its different forms of educational scaffoldings, seeks to provide with students an understanding of features of scientific knowledge and science in general, how scientific knowledge changes and becomes accepted, and what factors guide scientific activities. For a science teacher, deep and broad enough picture of sciences is therefore of importance. This study attempts to show that the research field called Science of Science (SoS) can significantly support building such a panoramic picture of sciences, and through that, significantly support NOS. The SoS approaches the structure and dynamics of science quantitatively, using scientific documents (e.g., publications, reports, books and monographs and patent applications) as trails to map the landscape of sciences. It is argued here that SoS may provide material and interesting cases for NOS, and in so doing enrich NOS in a similarly significant way as history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPSS) scholarship has done thus far. This study introduces several themes based on SoS that are of relevance for NOS as they were introduced and discussed in a pre-service science teachers’ course. The feedback from pre-service teachers shows that introducing SoS, with minimal additional philosophical interpretations and discussions, but simply as evidential facts and findings, sparks ideas and views that come very close to NOS themes and topics. Discussions related to nature of science, and specific educational NOS scaffoldings for it, can find a good companion in SoS; the latter providing facts and evidence of thee structure and dynamics of sciences, the former providing perspectives for interpretations. © 2021 by the author.

On many current issues (GMO crops, vaccinations, climate change) sectors of the public hold views differing from those of most scientists, and they often do not support proposals based on the scientists’ views. The overall cultural authority of science has also been challenged in the last decade by several negative trends in the sciences themselves, including widely-reported cases of fraud and failures in replication. With the support of professional science organizations, science communication specialists have stepped in aggressively to address science’s communication problems scientifically. This paper will examine the assumptions behind their advice on scientific information, their recommended strategies of framing, narration, and projecting trustworthiness, and their characterizations of audiences and the nature of science itself. From the perspective of rhetorical argumentation, the science communication literature does not promote addressing audiences as citizens capable of rational argumentation. But the science of science communication is likely to remain the dominant approach to public science with the professional science community. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Einstein believed that mentors are especially influential in a protégé's intellectual development, yet the link between mentorship and protégé success remains a mystery. We marshaled genealogical data on nearly 40,000 scientists who published 1,167,518 papers in biomedicine, chemistry, math, or physics between 1960 and 2017 to investigate the relationship between mentorship and protégé achievement. In our data, we find groupings of mentors with similar records and reputations who attracted protégés of similar talents and expected levels of professional success. However, each grouping has an exception: One mentor has an additional hidden capability that can be mentored to their protégés. They display skill in creating and communicating prizewinning research. Because the mentor's ability for creating and communicating celebrated research existed before the prize's conferment, protégés of future prizewinning mentors can be uniquely exposed to mentorship for conducting celebrated research. Our models explain 34-44% of the variance in protégé success and reveals three main findings. First, mentorship strongly predicts protégé success across diverse disciplines. Mentorship is associated with a 2×-to- 4× rise in a protégé's likelihood of prizewinning, National Academy of Science (NAS) induction, or superstardom relative to matched protégés. Second, mentorship is significantly associated with an increase in the probability of protégés pioneering their own research topics and being midcareer late bloomers. Third, contrary to conventional thought, protégés do not succeed most by following their mentors' research topics but by studying original topics and coauthoring no more than a small fraction of papers with their mentors. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The increasing availability of digital data on scholarly outputs offers unprecedented opportunities to explore science of science (SciSci). Despite many significant works have been done on SciSci, substantial disciplinary differences in different domains make some insights inadequate within particular fields. One thing standing out is that knowledge concerning the science behind AI is sorely lacking. In this work, we study the evolution of AI from three dimensions, including the evolution of trend, mobility, and collaboration. We find that the AI research hotspots have shifted from theory to application. The USA, which has the largest number of distinguished AI scientists, appeals most to the global AI talents. The brain drain problem of AI scientists is increasingly serious in developing countries. The ties among the AI elites are highly clustered in the collaboration network. Overall, our work aims to serve as a starter and support the development of AI exploring in a visionary way.

	abstract = {The Turing Award is recognized as the most influential and prestigious award in the field of computer science (CS). With the rise of the science of science, a large amount of bibliographic data has been analyzed in an attempt to understand the hidden mechanism of scientific evolution. These include the analysis of the Nobel Prize, including physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. In this article, we extract and analyze the data of 72 Turing Award laureates from the complete bibliographic data, fill the gap in the lack of Turing Award analysis, and discover the development characteristics of CS as an independent discipline. First, we show most Turing Award laureates have long-term and high-quality educational backgrounds, and more than 61% of them have a degree in mathematics, which indicates that mathematics has played a significant role in the development of CS. Secondly, the data shows that not all scholars have high productivity and high h-index; that is, the number of publications and h-index is not the leading indicator for evaluating the Turing Award. Third, the average age of awardees has increased from 40 to around 70 in recent years. This may be because new breakthroughs take longer, and some new technologies need time to prove their influence. Besides, we have also found that in the past 10 years, international collaboration has experienced explosive growth, showing a new paradigm in the form of collaboration. It is also worth noting that in recent years, the emergence of female winners has also been eye-catching. Finally, by analyzing the personal publication records, we find that many people are more likely to publish high-impact articles during their high-yield periods. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

However, collaboration in research often starts long before publication with data production efforts. In this project we ask how collaboration in data production networks affects and contributes to knowledge diffusion, as represented by patents, another form of knowledge diffusion. We drew our data from the metadata associated with genetic sequence records stored in the National Institutes of Health's GenBank database. After constructing networks for each year and aggregating summary statistics, regressions were used to test several hypotheses. Key among our findings is that data production team size is positively related to the number of patents each year. Also, when actors on average have more links, we tend to see more patents. Our study contributes in the area of science of science by highlighting the important role of data production in the diffusion of knowledge as measured by patents. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

	abstract = {The understanding of how science works can contribute to making scientific development more effective. In this paper, we report an analysis of the organization and the interconnection between unbalanced areas of study. More specifically, we considered two important subareas in analytical chemistry, namely capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry (MS). These areas are particularly interesting because MS is employed in a bigger range of applications than CE. Consequently, these different portions of papers can interfere in the quality of the searches for papers devoted to CE–MS. Here, we considered a citation network in which the nodes and connections represent papers and citations, respectively. The network clusters were detected by employing the Infomap algorithm. By considering the clusters and the respective abstracts, the subjects were identified. Interesting results were found, including a marked separation between some clusters of articles devoted to instrumentation techniques and applications, which was quantified from the abstract contents. For instance, the most well-defined community was assigned as CE (Instru.), with 73.8% of the papers having abstracts that include the word “electrophoresis” and not the word “mass”. However, the papers that describe CE–MS did not lead to a well-defined cluster. In order to better understand the organization of the citation network, we considered a multi-scale analysis, in which we used the information regarding sub-clusters. Firstly, we analyzed the sub-cluster that contains the first article devoted to the coupling between CE and MS, whose subject was found to be a good representation of its sub-cluster. The second analysis was about the sub-cluster of a seminal paper known to be the first that dealt with protein analysis by using CE–MS and a similar result was obtained. By considering the proposed methodologies, our paper can contribute to researchers working with similar scenarios, since it shows that a given subject can be spread on many clusters of the network, therefore, lead to better literature reviews. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Women and men often contribute differently to research knowledge. Do differences in these contributions partially explain disparities in academic career outcomes? We explore this by looking at how gender is embodied in research language, and then ascertain whether the adoption of more gendered research language affects career outcomes beyond the researcher's attributes. We identify different forms of gendered knowledge—gender referents (explicit references to sex and gender) and gender-associated terms (words that are implicitly associated with women or men researchers)—by applying natural language processing techniques to nearly one million doctoral dissertations published in the United States between 1980 and 2010. We then determine whether employing gender referents and gender-associated terms affects the course of PhDs’ ensuing careers. We find women researchers have lower chances of securing academic positions than men in every field; explicit references to women as research subjects are modestly rewarded in comparison to references to men; and more career opportunities are afforded to research knowledge associated with men. These results suggest that academia is slowly correcting the traditional and explicit bias of studying men at the exclusion of women. Still, there remains a stronger implicit bias against knowledge associated with women scholars. We discuss relative differences between humanities and social sciences versus natural sciences, technology, engineering, and math, as well as potential treatments for offsetting bias in those fields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The study of the global pool of theses and dissertations in disaster medicine can reflect the general structure of innovative research and will assist in reviewing current scientific literature in this field of knowledge. Intention is to analyze the structure and dynamics of the number of foreign dissertations in disaster medicine and compare them with similar indicators of Russian dissertations. Methodology. The object of study is the global pool of dissertations presented in the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global electronic database, Health & Medicine section, for the period 1992–2020 and an array of domestic dissertations in the scientific specialty 05.26.02 “Safety in emergency situations” (medical, biological and psychological sciences) for 1992–2020. The quantitative indicators of foreign and Russian dissertations in emergency medicine were compared. Results and Discussion. The electronic search made it possible to find 28,423 foreign doctoral (PhD) dissertations in the problems of disaster medicine. The polynomial trend with a very high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.97) shows an increase in the annual number of dissertations for the period 1992–2020. The average annual number of dissertations in the period under review was 980 ± 386. Dissertations described general provisions (4.7 %), tasks and organization of the disaster medicine service (8.3 %), forecasting and modeling of the health consequences of emergencies (4.8 %), organization of medical-sanitary support (18.5 %), provision of medical care and treatment of victims (14.9 %), medical control, examination and rehabilitation of rescuers (2.3 %), training of disaster medicine specialists (12.8 %), biological issues (6.2 %), psychiatric and psychological security problems (28.1 %). The general array of dissertations was analyzed by leading countries and universities. Quantity and scope of foreign dissertations on the problems of disaster medicine were compared with those of Russian dissertations over time. Conclusion. More than 95 % of the analyzed pool of disaster medicine dissertations in the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global database are published in full text. Our study makes it possible to optimize scientific research in the field of disaster medicine and also shows possible approaches to dissertation analysis when preparing own manuscripts. © 2022 Nikiforov Russian Center of Emergency and Radiation Medicine, EMERCOM of Russia},

	abstract = {Building publics’ understanding about human-environmental causes and impacts of nutrient pollution is difficult due to the diverse sources and, at times, extended timescales of increasing inputs, consequences to ecosystems, and recovery after remediation. Communicating environmental problems with “slow impacts” has long been a challenge for scientists, public health officials, and science communicators, as the time delay for subsequent consequences to become evident dilutes the sense of urgency to act. Fortunately, scientific research and practice in the field of climate change communication has begun to identify best practices to address these challenges. Climate change demonstrates a delay between environmental stressor and impact, and recommended practices for climate change communication illustrate how to explain and motivate action around this complex environmental problem. Climate change communication research provides scientific understanding of how people evaluate risk and scientific information about climate change. We used a qualitative coding approach to review the science communication and climate change communication literature to identify approaches that could be used for nutrients and how they could be applied. Recognizing the differences between climate change and impacts of nutrient pollution, we also explore how environmental problems with delayed impacts demand nuanced strategies for effective communication and public engagement. Applying generalizable approaches to successfully communicate the slow impacts related to nutrient pollution across geographic contexts will help build publics’ understanding and urgency to act on comprehensive management of nutrient pollution, thereby increasing protection of coastal and marine environments. © Copyright © 2021 Canfield, Mulvaney and Merrill.},

	abstract = {Over the last century scientific research has become an increasingly collaborative endeavor. Commentators have pointed to different factors which contribute to this trend, including the specialization of science and growing need for diversity of interest and expertise areas in a scientific team. Very few studies, however, have precisely evaluated how the diversity of interest topics between researchers is related to the emergence of collaboration. Existing theoretical arguments suggest a curvilinear relationship between topic similarity and collaboration: too little similarity can complicate communication and agreement, yet too much overlap can increase competition and limit the potential for synergy. We test this idea using data on six years of publications across all disciplines at a large U.S. research university (approximately 14,300 articles, 12,500 collaborations, and 3400 authors). Employing topic modelling and network statistical models, we analyze the relationship between topic overlap and the likelihood of coauthorship between two researchers while controlling for potential confounders. We find an inverted-U relationship in which the probability of collaboration initially increases with topic similarity, then rapidly declines after peaking at a similarity "sweet spot". Collaboration is most likely at low-to-moderate levels of topic overlap, which are substantially lower than the average self-similarity of scientists or research groups. These findings - which we replicate for different units of analysis (individuals and groups), genders of collaborators, disciplines, and collaboration types (intra- and interdisciplinary) - support the notion that researchers seek collaborators to augment their scientific and technical human capital. We discuss implications for theories of scientific collaboration and research policy.  © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The academia and industry have been pursuing network-on-chip (NoC) related research since two decades ago when there was an urgency to respond to the scaling and technological challenges imposed on intra-chip communication in SoC designs. Like any other research topic, NoC inevitably goes through its life cycle: A. it started up (2000-2007) and quickly gained traction in its own right; B. it then entered the phase of growth and shakeout (2008-2013) with the research outcomes peaked in 2010 and remained high for another four/five years; C. NoC research was considered mature and stable (2014-2020), with signs showing a steady slowdown. Although from time to time, excellent survey articles on different subjects/aspects of NoC appeared in the open literature, yet there is no general consensus on where we are in this NoC roadmap and where we are heading, largely due to lack of an overarching methodology and tool to assess and quantify the research outcomes and evolution. In this paper, we address this issue from the perspective of three specific complex networks, namely the citation network, the subject citation network, and the co-authorship network. The network structure parameters (e.g., modularity, diameter, etc.) and graph dynamics of the three networks are extracted and analyzed, which helps reveal and explain the reasons and the driving forces behind all the changes observed in NoC research over 20 years. Additional analyses are performed in this study to link interesting phenomena surrounding the NoC area. They include: (1) relationships between communities in citation networks and NoC subjects, (2) measure and visualization of a subject's influence score and its evolution, (3) knowledge flow among the six most popular NoC subjects and their relationships, (4) evolution of various subjects in terms of number of publications, (5) collaboration patterns and cross-community collaboration among the authors in NoC research, (6) interesting observation of career lifetime and productivity among NoC researchers, and finally (7) investigation of whether or not new authors are chasing hot subjects in NoC. All these analyses have led to a prediction of publications, subjects, and co-authorship in NoC research in the near future, which is also presented in the paper. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

These new tools declare far-reaching implications for the science of science because researchers have the possibility to employ a flexible approach and refuse to rely on pre-defined categories, as was common for previous studies in the sociology of science. New opportunities in data collection and analysis have attracted researchers from diverse scientific fields. The result is the application of new conceptual models that are no longer limited to sociological conceptualizations. © 2021 г.},

	abstract = {Articles in high-impact journals are, on average, more frequently cited. But are they cited more often because those articles are somehow more “citable”? Or are they cited more often simply because they are published in a high-impact journal? Although some evidence suggests the latter, the causal relationship is not clear. We here compare citations of preprints to citations of the published version to uncover the causal mechanism.Webuild on an earlier model of citation dynamics to infer the causal effect of journals on citations. We find that high-impact journals select articles that tend to attract more citations. At the same time, we find that high-impact journals augment the citation rate of published articles. Our results yield a deeper understanding of the role of journals in the research system. The use of journal metrics in research evaluation has been increasingly criticized in recent years and article-level citations are sometimes suggested as an alternative. Our results show that removing impact factors from evaluation does not negate the influence of journals. This insight has important implications for changing practices of research evaluation. © 2021 V. A. Traag.},

	abstract = {Over the last century, we observe a steady and exponential growth of scientific publications globally. The overwhelming amount of available literature makes a holistic analysis of the research within a field and between fields based on manual inspection impossible. Automatic techniques to support the process of literature review are required to find the epistemic and social patterns that are embedded in scientific publications. In computer sciences, new tools have been developed to deal with large volumes of data. In particular, deep learning techniques open the possibility of automated end-to-end models to project observations to a new, low-dimensional space where the most relevant information of each observation is highlighted. Using deep learning to build new representations of scientific publications is a growing but still emerging field of research. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential and limits of deep learning for gathering insights about scientific research articles. We focus on document-level embeddings based on the semantic and relational aspects of articles, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We explore the different outcomes generated by those techniques. Our results show that using NLP we can encode a semantic space of articles, while GNN we enable us to build a relational space where the social practices of a research community are also encoded. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Furthermore, we highlight how the topics have evolved through analysis of publication dates and also use author information to clarify the topics’ content. The results obtained have been reviewed and approved by 3 leading experts in this field and interestingly show that Chinese Science of Science has gradually become mature in the last 40 years, evolving from the general nature of the discipline itself to related disciplines and their potential interactions, from qualitative analysis to quantitative and visual analysis, and from general research on the social function of science to its more specific economic function and strategic function studies. Consequently, the proposed novel method can be used without supervision, parameters and help from any external knowledge to obtain very clear and precise insights about the development of a scientific domain. The output of the topic extraction part of the method (clustering + feature maximization) is finally compared with the output of the well-known LDA approach by experts in the domain which serves to highlight the very clear superiority of the proposed approach. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

In this article, we aim to understand the width by establishing our empirical study on a previously built structure, namely ego-centered citation networks (ECCNs). We remove the direct links to the focal publication and only retain the other edges in the network. Particularly, we examine the number and the size of the connected components of sub-networks of ECCNs in the whole Web of Science database. We find that the number and size of the connected components increase as the number of citations of publications rises, regardless of discipline, and that they are greater in recent publications than in older ones. We also observe that there are some differences in terms of the number/size of the connected components; particularly, the number/size of connected components for publications in Arts and Humanities is more “special” compared with other disciplines, and Natural Sciences tends to have greater values. These details are indicative in terms of the specializations of academia. Moreover, the findings have far-reaching implications on research assessment practices and literature searching. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We study international mobility in academia, with a focus on the migration of published researchers to and from Russia. Using an exhaustive set of over 2.4 million Scopus publications, we analyze all researchers who have published with a Russian affiliation address in Scopus-indexed sources in 1996–2020. The migration of researchers is observed through the changes in their affiliation addresses, which altered their mode countries of affiliation across different years. While only 5.2% of these researchers were internationally mobile, they accounted for a substantial proportion of citations. Our estimates of net migration rates indicate that while Russia was a donor country in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it has experienced a relatively balanced circulation of researchers in more recent years. These findings suggest that the current trends in scholarly migration in Russia could be better framed as brain circulation, rather than as brain drain. Overall, researchers emigrating from Russia outnumbered and outperformed researchers immigrating to Russia. Our analysis on the subject categories of publication venues shows that in the past 25 years, Russia has, overall, suffered a net loss in most disciplines, and most notably in the five disciplines of neuroscience, decision sciences, mathematics, biochemistry, and pharmacology. We demonstrate the robustness of our main findings under random exclusion of data and changes in numeric parameters. Our substantive results shed light on new aspects of international mobility in academia, and on the impact of this mobility on a national science system, which have direct implications for policy development. Methodologically, our novel approach to handling big data can be adopted as a framework of analysis for studying scholarly migration in other countries. © 2021, The Author(s).},

There are studies focusing on the overall performance of individuals with different problem choosing strategies. Here we ask a slightly different but relatively unexplored question: how is a scientist's change of research agenda associated with her change of scientific performance. Using publication records of over 14,000 authors in physics, we quantitatively measure the extent of research direction change and the performance change of individuals. We identify a strong positive correlation between the direction change and impact change. Scientists with a larger direction change not only are more likely to produce works with increased scientific impact compared to their past ones, but also have a higher growth rate of scientific impact. On the other hand, the direction change is not associated with productivity change. Those who stay in familiar topics do not publish faster than those who venture out and establish themselves in a new field. The gauge of research direction in this work is uncorrelated with the diversity of research agenda and the switching probability among topics, capturing the evolution of individual careers from a new point of view. Though the finding is inevitably affected by the survival bias, it sheds light on a range of problems in the career development of individual scientists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

As such, cultural evolution is highly relevant for the emerging “science of science communication” (SSC) in that it can help organize and guide the study of science communication efforts aimed at spreading scientifically accurate information and inspiring behavioral change. Here, I synthesize insights and theory from cultural evolution with central findings and concepts within the SSC with the aim of highlighting the inherent, but underexplored, consilience between these two fields. I demonstrate how cultural evolution can serve as an unifying framework for the SSC and how, conversely, science communication can serve as a fertile testing ground for applying, exploring, and advancing cultural evolutionary theory in a real-world setting that matters. Lastly, I highlight merits and limitations of previous applications of cultural evolution to science communication and conclude with some particularly outstanding questions that emerge at the intersection between cultural evolution and science communication research. © 2020, The Author(s).},

We investigate how improved data access shifts the quantity, quality, and diversity of scientific research. We examine the impact of reductions in cost and sharing restrictions for satellite imagery data from NASA's Landsat program (the longest record of remote-sensing observations of the Earth) on academic science using a sample of about 24,000 Landsat publications by over 34,000 authors matched to almost 3,000 unique study locations. Analyses show that improved access had a substantial and positive effect on the quantity and quality of Landsat-enabled science. Improved data access also democratizes science by disproportionately helping scientists from the developing world and lower-ranked institutions to publish using Landsat data. This democratization in turn increases the geographic and topical diversity of Landsat-enabled research. Scientists who start using Landsat data after access is improved tend to focus on previously understudied regions close to their home location and introduce novel research topics. These findings suggest that policies that improve access to valuable scientific data may promote scientific progress, reduce inequality among scientists, and increase the diversity of scientific research. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {The peer-reviewing process has long been regarded as an indispensable tool in ensuring the quality of a scientific publication. While previous studies have tried to understand the process as a whole, not much effort has been devoted to investigating the determinants and impacts of the content of the peer review itself. This study leverages open data from nearly 5,000 PeerJ publications that were eventually accepted. Using sentiment analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, mixed linear regression models, and logit regression models, we examine how the peer-reviewing process influences the acceptance timeline and contribution potential of manuscripts, and what modifications were typically made to manuscripts prior to publication. In an open review paradigm, our findings indicate that peer reviewers’ choice to reveal their names in lieu of remaining anonymous may be associated with more positive sentiment in their review, implying possible social pressure from name association. We also conduct a taxonomy of the manuscript modifications during a revision, studying the words added in response to peer reviewer feedback. This study provides insights into the content of peer reviews and the subsequent modifications authors make to their manuscripts. Copyright 2021 Matsui et al.},

	abstract = {With the increase in scientific publications and the diversification of research areas, science has become complex and interdisciplinary. Discovering important knowledge has become difficult even for researchers in specific domains. Previously proposed keyphrase extraction methods focus mainly on detecting intensively discussed topics in specific domains but do not distinguish concepts with the interdisciplinary spread from those discussed in narrow areas. Here, we propose a diffusion meme score that evaluates the knowledge diffusion distance in a paper citation network. The distance between papers that contain specific terms is measured by the network embedding space of the citation network. Using 57 million publication records from 48 years of Scopus, we evaluated newly appearing terms in and after 1975 in biomedical science papers using the proposed indicator. Approximately half of the top 20 terms were related to Nobel Prize or Clarivate Citation Laureates, and the top terms of the indicators were more likely to appear in Wikipedia than terms extracted using existing methods. Moreover, the top terms were unlikely to include specific minor diseases, which are often extracted using existing methods. Therefore, the diffusion meme score evaluates important terms from scientific literature and citation networks that are more interdisciplinary. Our method improves the understanding of young researchers regarding domains, the development of the history of science, and the evaluation of researcher contributions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Scholars across disciplines increasingly hear calls for more open and collaborative approaches to scientific research. The concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) provides a framework that integrates dispersed research efforts aiming to understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of applying open and collaborative research practices. While the OIS framework has already been taken up by science of science scholars, its conceptual underpinnings require further specification. In this essay, we critically examine the OIS concept and bring to light two key aspects: 1) how OIS builds upon Open Innovation (OI) research by adopting its attention to boundary-crossing knowledge flows and by adapting other concepts developed and researched in OI to the science context, as exemplified by two OIS cases in the area of research funding; 2) how OIS conceptualises knowledge flows across boundaries. While OI typically focuses on well-defined organisational boundaries, we argue that blurry and even invisible boundaries between communities of practice may more strongly constrain flows of knowledge related to openness and collaboration in science. Given the uptake of this concept, this essay brings needed clarity to the meaning of OIS, which has no particular normative orientation towards a close coupling between science and industry. We end by outlining the essay’s contributions to OI and the science of science, as well as to science practitioners. © 2021 The Author(s).

The nodes are unidentified concepts in machine learning, and the time-stamped edges indicate co-occurrence in scientific papers. Taking advantage of this temporal information, we perform node embedding on the graph at every year from 1994 to 2017, and apply two methods to find features for node pairs: the first method uses a transformer, while the other uses distance metrics combined with known link prediction features. The latter feature extraction technique with a 3-layer multi-layer perceptron achieved an AUC of 0.902 on predicting edges in the 2020 graph. Inspection of the resulting features suggests that the model does indeed pay attention to the dynamic nature of the features, e.g., how node-pair distance in embedding space changes over the years. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Even though computer science (CS) has had a historical lack of gender and race representation, its AI research affects everybody eventually. Being partially rooted in CS conferences, "AI ethics"(AIE) conferences such as FAccT and AIES have quickly become distinct venues where AI's societal implications are discussed and solutions proposed. However, it is largely unknown if these conferences improve upon the historical representational issues of traditional CS venues. In this work, we explore AIE conferences' evolution and compare them across demographic characteristics, publication content, and citation patterns. We find that AIE conferences have increased their internal topical diversity and impact on other CS conferences. Importantly, AIE conferences are highly differentiable, covering topics not represented in other venues. However, and perhaps contrary to the field's aspirations, white authors are more common while seniority and black researchers are represented similarly to CS venues. Our results suggest that AIE conferences could increase efforts to attract more diverse authors, especially considering their sizable roots in CS. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Scientific breakthroughs are commonly understood as discoveries that transform the knowledge frontier and have a major impact on science, technology, and society. Prior literature studying breakthroughs generally treats them as a homogeneous group in attempts to identify supportive conditions for their occurrence. In this paper, we argue that there are different types of scientific breakthroughs, which differ in their disciplinary occurrence and are associated with different considerations of use and citation impact patterns. We develop a typology of scientific breakthroughs based on three binary dimensions of scientific discoveries and use this typology to analyze qualitatively the content of 335 scientific articles that report on breakthroughs. For each dimension, we test associations with scientific disciplines, reported use considerations, and scientific impact. We find that most scientific breakthroughs are driven by a question and in line with literature, and that paradigm shifting discoveries are rare. Regarding the scientific impact of breakthrough as measured by citations, we find that an article that answers an unanswered question receives more citations compared to articles that were not motivated by an unanswered question. We conclude that earlier research in which breakthroughs were operationalized as highly cited scientific articles may thus be biased against the latter. © 2020 Mignon Wuestman, Jarno Hoekman, and Koen Frenken.

Next, we constructed two networks of scientific collaboration among the educators of each country. By analyzing these networks’ topological properties, we show both countries’ differences and common features.

Although large-scale bibliometric data have been used to measure international migration of scholars, our understanding of internal migration among researchers is very limited. This is partly due to a lack of data aggregated at a suitable sub-national level. In this study, we analyze internal migration in Mexico based on over 1.1 million authorship records from the Scopus database. We trace the movements of scholars between Mexican states, and provide key demographic measures of internal migration for the 1996–2018 period. From a methodological perspective, we develop a new framework for enhancing data quality, inferring states from affiliations, and detecting moves from modal states for the purposes of studying internal migration among researchers. Substantively, we combine demographic and network science techniques to improve our understanding of internal migration patterns within country boundaries. The migration patterns between states in Mexico appear to be heterogeneous in size and direction across regions. However, while many scholars remain in their regions, there seems to be a preference for Mexico City and the surrounding states as migration destinations. We observed that over the past two decades, there has been a general decreasing trend in the crude migration intensity. However, the migration network has become more dense and more diverse, and has included greater exchanges between states along the Gulf and the Pacific Coast. Our analysis, which is mostly empirical in nature, lays the foundations for testing and developing theories that can rely on the analytical framework developed by migration scholars, and the richness of appropriately processed bibliometric data. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale datasets on scholarly outputs, science itself has come under the microscope with the aim of capturing a quantitative understanding of its workings. In this study, we leverage well-established cognitive models coming from anthropology in order to characterise the personal network of collaborations between scientists, i.e., the network considered from the standpoint of each individual researcher (referred to as ego network), in terms of the cognitive investment they devote to the different collaborations. Building upon these models, we study the interplay between the structure of academic collaborations, academic performance, and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into account both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes) and geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different countries). For our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the geo-referenced publications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from Scopus, one of the biggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main finding is that there is a clear correlation between the structure of co-authorship ego networks and academic performance indices: the more one publishes and the higher their impact, the larger their collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity bound effect, whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become increasingly less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find that international academic migrants are better at growing their networks than researchers that only migrate within the same country, but the latter seem to be better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve higher impact. High academic mobility does not appear to translate into better academic performance or larger collaboration networks. This shows a different finding with respect to related literature, where scientific productivity is seen as directly linked to mobility. Our results show that, when looking at impact of research, this is not necessarily the case. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The increasing availability of digital data on scholarly outcomes offers unprecedented opportunities to explore SciSci. In the progress of science, the previously discovered knowledge principally inspires new scientific ideas, and citation is a reasonably good reection of this cumulative nature of scientific research. The researchers that choose potentially inuential references will have a lead over the emerging publications. Although the peer-review process is the mainly reliable way of predicting a paper's future impact, the ability to foresee the lasting impact based on citation records is increasingly essential in the scientific impact analysis in the era of big data. This paper develops an attention mechanism for the long-term scientific impact prediction and validates the method based on a real large-scale citation data set.

In this paper, we investigate and visualize the on-going advancements of early scientific research on COVID-19 from the perspective of AI. By adopting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, this paper allocates the research articles into 50 key research topics pertinent to COVID-19 according to their abstracts. We present an overview of early studies of the COVID-19 crisis at different scales including referencing/citation behavior, topic variation and their inner interactions. We also identify innovative papers that are regarded as the cornerstones in the development of COVID-19 research.

Science should find a way to give appropriate response to the challenges of the “audit society”. Philosophy of complexity considers the self-consciousness of science as a complex organism, as a system containing a lot of subsystems, that develops under influence of many internal and external factors, is necessary for this purpose. It implies the development of “science of science” (SciSci) as a complex discipline within there would be a real interaction between the philosophy of science, history of science, sociology of science, scientometrics, psychology of scientific creativity, economy of science, studies in policy in science an legal regulation and legal aspects of scientific activity. © 2020, Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Scientific discovery has long been one of the central driving forces in our civilization. It uncovered the principles of the world we live in, and enabled us to invent new technologies reshaping our society, cure diseases, explore unknown new frontiers, and hopefully lead us to build a sustainable society. Accelerating the speed of scientific discovery is therefore one of the most important endeavors. This requires an in-depth understanding of not only the subject areas but also the nature of scientific discoveries themselves. In other words, the “science of science” needs to be established, and has to be implemented using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to be practically executable. At the same time, what may be implemented by “AI Scientists” may not resemble the scientific process conducted by human scientist. It may be an alternative form of science that will break the limitation of current scientific practice largely hampered by human cognitive limitation and sociological constraints. It could give rise to a human-AI hybrid form of science that shall bring systems biology and other sciences into the next stage. The Nobel Turing Challenge aims to develop a highly autonomous AI system that can perform top-level science, indistinguishable from the quality of that performed by the best human scientists, where some of the discoveries may be worthy of Nobel Prize level recognition and beyond. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used for modeling scholarly communication, performing scientometric analyses, and supporting a variety of intelligent services to explore the literature and predict research dynamics. However, they often suffer from incompleteness (e.g., missing affiliations, references, research topics), leading to a reduced scope and quality of the resulting analyses. This issue is usually tackled by computing knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and applying link prediction techniques. However, only a few KGE models are capable of taking weights of facts in the knowledge graph into account. Such weights can have different meanings, e.g. describe the degree of association or the degree of truth of a certain triple. In this paper, we propose the Weighted Triple Loss, a new loss function for KGE models that takes full advantage of the additional numerical weights on facts and it is even tolerant to incorrect weights. We also extend the Rule Loss, a loss function that is able to exploit a set of logical rules, in order to work with weighted triples. The evaluation of our solutions on several knowledge graphs indicates significant performance improvements with respect to the state of the art. Our main use case is the large-scale AIDA knowledge graph, which describes 21 million research articles. Our approach enables to complete information about affiliation types, countries, and research topics, greatly improving the scope of the resulting scientometrics analyses and providing better support to systems for monitoring and predicting research dynamics. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The intention is an analysis of articles in the field of eliminating the biomedical consequences of the Chernobyl accident in the world and in Russia, indexed in the Scopus database in 1986–2018. A search query gave an array of 3929 articles in Scopus. The largest number of articles was published by authors from the USA (13.2%), Ukraine (12.6%) and Russia (12.2%). A significant number of articles were published by international authors. The average annual number of articles was (119±6) in the whole array and (15±2) in the Russian array. In the whole array, 11.5% of the articles dealt with the biomedical problems of the liquidators of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident; 12.5% – the population living in the radioactively-contaminated territories; 18.7% – neoplasms; 8.6% – medical radiation physics; 21.2% – radioecology; 12.0% – biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology. In the Russian array, these respective percentages were 19.8, 17.3, 18.1, 21.7, 18.8% and 10.2%. On average, there were 10.5 citations per article, 70% of the articles were at least once cited, self-citations made up to 17.6%, and the Hirsch index was 81. A quite high demand for articles in the field of eliminating the biomedical consequences of the Chernobyl accident has been revealed among the world scientific community. Russian scientists should form a habit of quoting articles from their colleagues more often. Some domestic magazines still have a low publishing culture. A lack of transliterated lists of references not only precludes from indexing articles in Scopus, but also interferes with citing research papers from domestic scientists, their affiliated research institutions, and Russia as a whole. © 2021, Saint-Petersburg Research Institute of Radiation Hygiene after Professor P.V.

(ii) How did the scientific discourse in psychology change over the last decades, especially since the advent of neurosciences? (iii) And was this change carried by high impact (HI) or less prestigious journals? Our results reveal that topics related to natural sciences are trending, while their ’counterparts’ leaning to humanities are declining in popularity. Those trends are even more pronounced in the leading outlets of the field. Furthermore, our findings indicate a continued interest in methodological topics accompanied by the ascent of neurosciences and related methods and technologies (e.g. fMRI’s). At the same time, other established approaches (e.g. psychoanalysis) become less popular and indicate a relative decline of topics related to the social sciences and the humanities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Academic psychology in the USA is a gender success story in terms of overturning its early male dominance but there are still relatively few senior female psychology researchers. To assess whether there are gender differences in citation impact that might help to explain either of these trends, this study investigates psychology articles since 1996. Seven out of eight Scopus psychology categories had a majority of female first-authored journal articles by 2018. From regression analyses of first and last author gender and team size, female first authors associate with a slightly higher average citation impact, but extra authors have a 10 times stronger association with higher average citation impact. Last author gender has little association with citation impact. Female first authors are more likely to be in larger teams and if team size is attributed to the first author's work, then their apparent influence of female first authors on citation impact doubles. While gender differences in average citation impact are too small to account for gender-related trends in academic psychology, they warn that male-dominated citation-based ranking lists of psychologists do not reflect the state of psychology research today. © 2019 International Union of Psychological Science},

Taking the scientist cooperation network of Condensed matter physics, General relativity quantum cosmology and High energy physics phenomenology as the research object, the overlapping community structure in the network is detected by using the label propagation algorithm based on seed diffusion. Through community analysis, it is found that when the scale of scientists' cooperative network increases, the increase in the number of communities is not obvious, but the scale of each community will increase, and the probability of scientists belonging to overlapping communities will decrease. This shows that the increase in the number of authoritative scientists is not obvious after the unpopular research field becomes a popular research field. In hot research fields, the division of scientists' cooperation circles is clearer, and the cooperation frequency between circles will decrease significantly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Scientists’ leaving scientific work at an age when they should have continued generating more scientific output inevitably leads to limited success in their careers as scientists. However, this phenomenon has received relatively little attention in science of science and scientometrics, relative to how frequently it occurs in academia. Motivated by this gap, this study seeks to identify and characterize scientists who leave the profession before the expected time in science, i.e., scientists whose productivity digresses from the normal pattern at a stage when they should be capable of publishing more papers. We first argue that simply using the termination of publishing as the sign of leaving the profession is inappropriate. Using termination of publishing as the only standard also leads to an underestimation of the overall productivity of certain types of scientists. Thus, we designed a novel measure to evaluate whether a scientist has left science. Utilizing a large-scale bibliographic dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) in the field of mathematics, we identified over 10,000 scientists who left before their 20th career year, and paired each of them with a scientist who survived for longer than 25 years. We found that the characteristics in the first five years of the careers of the scientists who left early can be summarized as incompetency in their research abilities and a lack of collaboration with senior or highly cited authors. The implications of the findings are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Junior faculty spend a great deal of time finding the right agencies and programs that best match their research profile. But what are the factors that influence the best publication–grant matching? Some universities might employ pre-award personnel to understand these factors, but not all institutions can afford to hire them. Historical records of publications funded by grants can help us understand the matching process and also help us develop recommendation systems to automate it. In this work, we present GotFunding (Grant recOmmendaTion based on past FUNDING), a recommendation system trained on National Institutes of Healthʼs (NIH) grant–publication records. Our system achieves a high performance (NDCG@1 = 0.945) by casting the problem as learning to rank. By analyzing the features that make predictions effective, our results show that the ranking considers most important (a) the year difference between publication and grant, (b) the amount of information provided in the publication, and (c) the relevance of the publication to the grant.

	abstract = {In this paper, I draw on philosophy of science to address a challenge for science communication. Empirical research indicates that some people who trust a meteorologist's report that they are in the path of a storm do not trust a climate scientist's report that we are on a path to global warming. Such selective skepticism about climate science exemplifies a more general challenge: The Challenge of Selective Uptake Laypersons who generally accept public scientific testimony nevertheless fail to accept public scientific testimony concerning select, equally well warranted, scientific hypotheses. A prominent response arising from the novel interdisciplinary science of science communication is a principle called Consensus Reporting. According to this principle, science reporters should, whenever feasible, report the scientific consensus or lack thereof for a reported scientific view. However, philosophy of science may offer a different perspective on the issue. This perspective is critical insofar as it indicates some inadequacies of Consensus Reporting. But it is also constructive insofar as it guides the development of an alternative principle, Justification Reporting, according to which science reporters should, whenever feasible, report aspects of the nature and strength of scientific justification or lack thereof for a reported scientific view. A central difference between these proposals is that Consensus Reporting appeals to the authority of the scientists whereas Justification Reporting appeals to the authority of scientific justification. As such, Justification Reporting reflects the image of science. The paper considers the philosophical and empirical motivation for Justification Reporting and its limitations. This includes prospects and problems for implementing it in a way that addresses The Challenge of Selective Uptake. From a methodological point of view, the paper illustrates how empirically informed philosophy of science may help address challenges for science communication. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Following the latter’s definition of philosophy as the ‘science of science’, philosophy is to be understood as a normative theory of what should qualify as science. In order to ground scientific knowledge-production as such, philosophy itself has to acquire a scientific method, through the application of which the constitution of scientific knowledge is secured. In systematic continuity to Kant’s account of geometrical construction, Fichte develops a philosophical method that exploits the special epistemic conditions of performativity. Construction is then defined as an experimental, self-reflexive performance that exemplifies consciousness. Throughout its acts of exemplification this reflexive kind of self-observation yields a particular type of experience, which ultimately satisfies the Science of Knowledge’s demand for certainty, that is intellectual intuition. © 2020 Brill Rodopi.

In this paper, we analyze whether several factors influence the number of citations in the domain of covert channels/steganography (CC/St). In particular, we study the significant differences on average yearly citations received by journal, conference and workshop publications. We also analyze the influence of tier-levels, number of references, number of pages, type of contribution, and number of authors on the average yearly citations.

	abstract = {Scholarly impact assessment has always been a hot issue. It has played an important role in evaluating researchers, scientific papers, scientific teams, and institutions within science of science. Scholarly impact assessment is also used to address fundamental issues, such as reward evaluation, funding allocation, promotion and recruitment decision. Scholars generally agree that it is more reasonable to use weighted citations to assess the scholarly impact. Although a great number of researchers use weighted citations to access the scholarly impact, there is a lack of a systematic summary of citation weighting methods. To fill the gap, this paper summarizes the existing classical indicators and weighting methods used in measuring scholarly impact from the perspectives of articles, authors and journals. We also summarize the focus of the indicators involved in this paper and the weighting factors that involved in the weighting methods. Finally, we discuss the open issues to try to discover the hidden trends of citation weighting. Through this paper, we can not only have a clearer understanding of the weighting methods in the scholarly impact assessment, but also think more deeply about the weighting factors to be explored. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

Part One presents the objections raised by Socrates against Critias' notion of sǒphrosuné as reflexive science in the Charmides, and suggests ways in which Aristotle may have taken these objections into account. Part Two discusses selectively certain features of sǒphrosuné in Republic IV and argues that this latter conception lies farther from the Char-mides but closer to Aristotle's view of that virtue. Part Three situates Aristotle's view of sǒphrosuné, on the one hand, in respect of his conception of the virtues of character and his own method of analysis and, on the other hand, in respect of the aforementioned dialogues of Plato. One result of the present study is that it identifies crucial differences between Plato's and Aristotle's treatments of sǒphrosuné, and also indicates how Aristotle both registers the points made by Plato and sufficiently distances himself from his older colleague in order to offer his own, very distinctive analysis of this specific virtue. © 2018 Editions OUSIA.

	abstract = {Rapid research progress in science and technology (S&T) and continuously shifting workforce needs exert pressure on each other and on the educational and training systems that link them. Higher education institutions aim to equip new generations of students with skills and expertise relevant to workforce participation for decades to come, but their offerings sometimes misalign with commercial needs and new techniques forged at the frontiers of research. Here, we analyze and visualize the dynamic skill (mis-) alignment between academic push, industry pull, and educational offerings, paying special attention to the rapidly emerging areas of data science and data engineering (DS/DE). The visualizations and computational models presented here can help key decision makers understand the evolving structure of skills so that they can craft educational programs that serve workforce needs. Our study uses millions of publications, course syllabi, and job advertisements published between 2010 and 2016. We show how courses mediate between research and jobs. We also discover responsiveness in the academic, educational, and industrial system in how skill demands from industry are as likely to drive skill attention in research as the converse. Finally, we reveal the increasing importance of uniquely human skills, such as communication, negotiation, and persuasion. These skills are currently underexamined in research and undersupplied through education for the labor market. In an increasingly data-driven economy, the demand for “soft” social skills, like teamwork and communication, increase with greater demand for “hard” technical skills and tools. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Three mechanisms underlying cognitive dynamics of research routines are identified and examined using the case of microRNAs research. Their mutual interaction is attributed to propagation of shock impulses. Some inherent limitations of alternative scientometric approaches, such as the gradient of flow vergence, are examined. They presumably arise because of the particularistic orientation of the dominant scientometric approaches. The paper concludes by advocating processualist approach to dynamics of scientific research and postulating a more detailed examination of the nature of shock impulses. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Nobel prizes are often split, such that up to three awardees receive a corresponding fractional prize. The historical trends for the fractional number of Nobelists per population are surprisingly robust, indicating in particular that the maximum Nobel productivity peaked in the 1970s for the USA and around 1900 for both France and Germany. The yearly success rates of these three countries are to date of the order of 0.2-0.3 physics, chemistry and medicine laureates per 100 million inhabitants, with the US value being a factor of 2.4 down from the maximum attained in the 1970s. The UK in contrast managed to retain during most of the last century a rate of 0.9-1.0 science Nobel prizes per year and per 100 million inhabitants. For the USA, one finds that the entire history of science Noble prizes is described on a per capita basis to an astonishing accuracy by a single large productivity boost decaying at a continuously accelerating rate since its peak in 1972. © 2018 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The article considers statistical laws of scientific communications and describes the phenomena and processes of self-organization in library science, science of science, and linguistics. Synergetics is chosen as the methodological basis of research. The aim of the study is to develop a synergistic concept of the emergence of statistical laws of information processes and phenomena in scientific communications for their generalization and presentation in the form of a single law. The concept of synergetics is developed for scientific communications as a manifestation of objectively existing but theoretically unsubstantiated quantitative relations between the subjects and objects of these communications (scientists, publications, and terms). The necessity of using stable distribution laws of probability theory for describing scale-invariant phenomena and processes is noted. In the mathematical sense, the stability of the distribution law is the property of preserving its type for any sum of random variables having this distribution. The mathematical abstraction of a ‘random variable’ in scientific communications takes on a clear concreteness. For Bradford’s regularity, the random variable is the number of articles on a particular topic in the journal; for Lotka’s regularity, it is the number of scholar’s publications; and for Zipf’s regularity, it is the frequency of using the word in the text. The study has determined the characteristic indicator of the stable law of the distribution of processes and phenomena in scientific communications, which is equal to the constant of the golden section. A synergistic concept of scientific communications is formulated as follows: scale-invariant processes and phenomena of self-organization are a manifestation of a stable distribution law of probability theory with a characteristic indicator equal to the constant of the golden ratio },

To improve the quality of publications while maintaining their growth rate, employees of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia have approved a methodology for assessing the integrated score of publication performance of organizations. Intention. Analysis of the integrated score of publication performance of the leading educational and scientific organizations of the Russian Emergencies Ministry for 10 years (2010–2019). Methodology. The object of the study was the annual indicators of the integrated score of publication performance of the Russian EMERCOM as calculated by the staff of the Scientific Electronic Library [https://www.elibrary.ru/]. Results and Discussion. A low average annual integrated score of publication performance was revealed in the EMERCOM of Russia. For an educational organization in the Russian EMERCOM, it amounted to (55.67 ±5.8) points, for a research organization – (29.0 ± 1.5) points (p < 0.01). The average annual integrated score of publication performance for the same period at Omsk State Technical University turned out to be 6 times higher (306.4 ± 19.0) than the average for educational institutions of the Russian EMERCOM (p < 0.001). It turned out that the EMERCOM of Russia had few highly rated publications on computer and information sciences, physical and chemical branches of knowledge, and quite a lot of publications on social sciences. Most likely, the latter are not a priority in the state assignment for research and development of the EMERCOM of Russia. Shown are the ways to increase the integrated score of publication performance of the EMERCOM of Russia organizations. Conclusion. The slogan of researchers “print or die” in modern conditions is becoming less and less relevant. Russian and world science were flooded with insignificant and sometimes false publications. The fractional calculation of the integrated score of publication performance will make the authors think before including anyone in gift co-authorship or creating “fake” affiliations. This methodology will help improve the quality of domestic publications, and printing weak articles will become irrelevant. © 2020 Medico-Biological and Socio-Psychological Issues of Safety in Emergency Situations.

One in 10 journals had their IF boosted by more than 50% by their top three cited papers. Because the single-paper effect on the IF is inversely proportional to journal size, small journals are rewarded much more strongly than large journals for a highly cited paper, while they are penalized more for a low-cited paper, especially if their IF is high. This skewed reward mechanism incentivizes high-IF journals to stay small to remain competitive in rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough papers appearing in prestigious journals. We question the reliability of IF rankings given the high IF sensitivity to a few papers that affects thousands of journals. © 2020 Manolis Antonoyiannakis.

But this research framework is still insufficient with only network topology information of scientific literature and lack of considering true relationships between papers. Thanks to information technology, the distance between two contents can be evaluated by mapping them into a high-dimensional space based on the theme of each paper, which is automatically created by analyzing the abstract of paper via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This paper analyzed some data from APS dataset with measures of distances between article pairs. The analysis of the pattern of scholars carrying out their research shows that, most scholars have concentrated rather than extensive research areas. Especially scientists’ new researches are highly relevant to previous studies. Besides, this paper shows the scholar’s citation behavior is not random. The citation behavior is basically concentrated in a limited interval, and the reference preference reaching a maximum at a certain distance. It implies there is a “most proper citation distance”. Furthermore, they have a strong preference to cite the academic masters’ articles. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {International mobility facilitates the exchange of scientific, institutional and cultural knowledge. Yet whether globalization and advances in virtual communication technologies have altered the impact of researcher mobility is a relevant and open question that we address by analysing a broad international set of 26 170 physicists from 1980 to 2009, focusing on the 10-year period centred around each mobility event to assess the impact of mobility on research outcomes. We account for secular globalization trends by splitting the analysis into three periods, measuring for each period the effect of mobility on researchers' citation impact, research topic diversity, collaboration networks and geographical coordination. In order to identify causal effects we leverage statistical matching methods that pair mobile researchers with non-mobile researchers that are similar in research profile attributes prior the mobility event. We find that mobile researchers gain up to a 17% increase in citations relative to their non-mobile counterparts, which can be explained by the simultaneous increase in their diversity of co-authors, topics and geographical coordination in the period immediately following migration. Nevertheless, we also observe that researcher's completely curtail prior collaborations with their source country in 11% of the cross-border mobility events. As such, these individual-level perturbations fuel multiscale churning in scientific networks, e.g. rewiring the connectivity of individuals and ideas and affecting international integration. Together these results provide additional clarity on the complex relationship between human capital mobility and the dynamics of social capital investment, with implications for immigration and national innovation system policy. © 2018 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Applying science to the current art of producing engineering and research knowledge has proven difficult, in large part because of its seeming complexity. We posit that the microscopic processes underlying research are not so complex, but instead are iterative and interacting cycles of divergent (generation of ideas) and convergent (testing and selecting of ideas) thinking processes. This reductionist framework coherently organizes a wide range of previously disparate microscopic mechanisms which inhibit these processes. We give examples of such inhibitory mechanisms and discuss how deeper scientific understanding of these mechanisms might lead to dis-inhibitory interventions for individuals, networks and institutional levels. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Faculty at prestigious institutions produce more scientific papers, receive more citations and scholarly awards, and are typically trained at more-prestigious institutions than faculty with less prestigious appointments. This imbalance is often attributed to a meritocratic system that sorts individuals into more-prestigious positions according to their reputation, past achievements, and potential for future scholarly impact. Here, we investigate the determinants of scholarly productivity and measure their dependence on past training and current work environments. To distinguish the effects of these environments, we apply a matched-pairs experimental design to career and productivity trajectories of 2,453 early-career faculty at all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada, who together account for over 200,000 publications and 7.4 million citations. Our results show that the prestige of faculty’s current work environment, not their training environment, drives their future scientific productivity, while current and past locations drive prominence. Furthermore, the characteristics of a work environment are more predictive of faculty productivity and impact than mechanisms representing preferential selection or retention of more-productive scholars by more-prestigious departments. These results identify an environmental mechanism for cumulative advantage, in which an individual’s past successes are “locked in” via placement into a more prestigious environment, which directly facilitates future success. The scientific productivity of early-career faculty is thus driven by where they work, rather than where they trained for their doctorate, indicating a limited role for doctoral prestige in predicting scientific contributions. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

However, few studies have attempted to map the global research of sustainable city. This study aimed to reveal the global performance and development of sustainable city research during 1992 to 2016, using a bibliometric analysis based on Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) on Web of Science. Research performance, research emphases and trends were illustrated by bibliometric indicators and newly developed visualization tools, like Science of Science (Sci2), Gephi, and alluvial diagram. Sustainable city research in natural science and social science were well-matched in quantity, and had similar and different characteristics in terms of different investigated aspects. China ranked first in natural science research, while the USA was the leading country in social science research. More categories and clusters were involved in sustainable city field, indicating more interdisciplinary integration was undergoing. Energy and fuels in natural science field, and interdisciplinary applications mathematics in social science field started to attract more attention. Statistical analysis of words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus has been investigated to monitor the development of sustainable city research. Finally, three critical issues in sustainable city research based on the clues by the analysis of these keywords were reviewed and discussed. © 2019},

	abstract = {The article analyzes the historiographic texts of the first wave of Russian émigré historians. In these texts, the Soviet historiographic process of the 1920s and 1930s was interpreted. The relevance of the study is associated both with the poor study of historiographic texts created during that period in emigration, and with the narrative turn of modern historical science, as well as with the experience of understanding the structure and nature of the Soviet narrative, which is beginning to be comprehended and problematized as an independent problem. The study of narratives makes it possible to move away from general assessments of the Soviet stage of historical studies to a more specific description of it through studying the stylistics of the text, isolating the standards and the uniqueness of their construction, with close attention to the problems of their unification. This process can be clarified and refined through the prism of the “emigre mirror”. The source base was the historiographic texts of P.N. Milyukov, A.A. Kizevetter, A.V. Florovsky, and E.F. Maksimovich in the form of published works and manuscript heritage from the archives of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ARAN) and the Slavic Library in Prague (Slovanská knihovna v Praze). Based on textual analysis and developments in the field of intellectual history, the author highlights the unifying features of the émigré narrative. These include: 1) scholars’ understanding of their special mission in emigration which consists of preserving the historiographic tradition and presenting Russian historical science to the world community as part of world science; 2) close attention to the classics, focus on tradition; 3) an assessment of the historiographic process within the framework of the reference time, the Golden age of pre-revolutionary historical science (late 19th – early 20th centuries); the criterion for assessing the current historiographic process was the compliance with the experience of Moscow and St. Petersburg scientific schools; 4) a statement about the lack of freedom of research, the monopoly of Marxist methodology and the hypertrophied class approach in relation to the historicist views of historians; 5) changes in the form and structure of the classic narrative – the proportion of reviews, literature reviews, obituaries in the structure of emigrant narrative was increasing; the deconstruction of the old narrative followed the path of its archaization; 6) the unifying factor that tightened the texts, gave them tension and a special emotional charge, was the figure of M.N. Pokrovsky. However, the verification of the current historiographic process by one’s own past is not without contradictions. On the one hand, this ensures the continuity of historiographic knowledge and confirms the thesis of the intrinsic value of the so-called «outdated innovations». In addition, in this regard, we can talk about the fundamental eclecticism of science as a cultural tradition. On the other hand, the reciprocating nature is fraught with a closure on the old. The absolutization of tradition leads to the blocking of intellectual transfers. In science of science, this process is called the rut effect. As an example of searching for «one’s own track», the article presents an attempt by A.V. Florovsky to understand and to clarify the phenomenon of Soviet historiography by coarsening the classical historiographic approach and using the inventory-registration method. As a result, he managed to present the meaningful complexity of the internal structure of Soviet historical science. © 2020, Perm State University. All rights reserved.},

Codd. We specifically analyze the topics of the published papers, the relevance of authors and papers, and how this relates to raw publication counts.

Furthermore, it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have the growth potential to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS data sets from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging, and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increased significantly for merging events and decreased significantly for splitting events. Our results represent the first step from a descriptive understanding of the science of science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive. © 2019 by the authors.},

We study how a single paper affects the IF using data from 11639 journals in the 2017 Journal Citation Reports. We define as volatility the IF gain (or loss) caused by a single paper, and this is inversely proportional to journal size. We find high volatilities for hundreds of journals annually due to their top-cited paper—whether it is a highly-cited paper in a small journal, or a moderately (or even low) cited paper in a small and low-cited journal. For example, 1218 journals had their most cited paper boost their IF by more than 20%, while for 231 journals the boost exceeded 50%. We find that small journals are rewarded much more than large journals for publishing a highly-cited paper, and are also penalized more for publishing a low-cited paper, especially if they have a high IF. This produces a strong incentive for prestigious, high-IF journals to stay small, to remain competitive in IF rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough papers to appear in prestigious journals. We also question the practice of ranking journals by IF given this uneven reward mechanism. © 2019 17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2019 - Proceedings.

	abstract = {In China, it has long become imperative for the management of education, science and technology to build up high-level teams of scientific and technological innovation. Scientifically and accurately identifying core scientific research teams is an important prerequisite for cultivating and building such teams. The absolute threshold method (e.g., c-level clique at, n- clique, kcore) is the prevailing means of identifying core teams and their core members. Multiple factors such as "the preference-dependent effect", "the apostle effect" and "the star effect", and the cooperative relationship between the researchers could be considered. This study, based on the co-authorship network, found that not choosing the absolute threshold properly could easily lead to poor identification of core members of some teams. Even worse, when the absolute threshold is too large, this "uniform" evaluation criterion of tie strength results in the elimination of some core teams in some disciplines. This paper uses the relative tie strength to identify core scientific research teams from a new perspective, which can effectively avoid the situation of some core team members being ignored because of the mandatory requirements of the absolute tie strength among members, and can also solve the challenge of threshold selections for identifying different teams. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify embedded communities among Medical Ethics scholars in France based on their position and strength of association in the social networks they form. Design/methodology/approach: The author constructed a co-authorship network by linking two authors if they co-authored a paper. Once the co-authorship network was constructed, the author investigated the entire network quantitatively using standard research methods known as social network analysis. The author’s mechanism of community detection was via identification, i.e. communities were user-defined based on topological analysis. Findings: The study identified that communities formed by trust (bonding or repeat connections) or by prestige (connection of well-connected scholars with those that are already well-connected) overlap each other, suggesting that trust and prestige may go hand in hand in sustaining communities. Structural holes within trust networks indicated that some actors played more of a broker role than did other actors. Research limitations/implications: The study uses Web of Science field based category to extract data. Although thorough cleaning of data has been performed, author disambiguation over a three decade period remains a limitation. Originality/value: Although there have been numerous studies on mapping co-authorship networks, there has been limited work investigating the underlying communities formed by author associations. The results of this study should be of immense benefit to those studying the science of science and S&T policy. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper builds on the ideas and conversations from the session to provide a more nuanced discussion about the context surrounding responsible communication and decision-making for cases of post-normal science. Deciding to use gene drives to control and suppress pests will involve more than a technical assessment of the risks involved, and responsible decision-making regarding their use will require concerted efforts from multiple actors. We provide a review of gene drives and their potential applications, as well as the role of journalists in communicating the extent of uncertainties around specific projects. We also discuss the roles of public opinion and online environments in public engagement with scientific processes. We conclude with specific recommendations about how to address current challenges and foster more effective communication and decision-making for complex, post-normal issues, such as gene drives. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Citation averages, and Impact Factors (IFs) in particular, are sensitive to sample size. Here, we apply the Central Limit Theorem to IFs to understand their scale-dependent behavior. For a journal of n randomly selected papers from a population of all papers, we expect from the Theorem that its IF fluctuates around the population average μ, and spans a range of values proportional to                                  , where σ2 is the variance of the population's citation distribution. The                                   dependence has profound implications for IF rankings: The larger a journal, the narrower the range around μ where its IF lies. IF rankings therefore allocate an unfair advantage to smaller journals in the high IF ranks, and to larger journals in the low IF ranks. As a result, we expect a scale-dependent stratification of journals in IF rankings, whereby small journals occupy the top, middle, and bottom ranks; mid-sized journals occupy the middle ranks; and very large journals have IFs that asymptotically approach μ. We obtain qualitative and quantitative confirmation of these predictions by analyzing (i) the complete set of 166,498 IF & journal-size data pairs in the 1997-2016 Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, (ii) the top-cited portion of 276,000 physics papers published in 2014-2015, and (iii) the citation distributions of an arbitrarily sampled list of physics journals. We conclude that the Central Limit Theorem is a good predictor of the IF range of actual journals, while sustained deviations from its predictions are a mark of true, non-random, citation impact. IF rankings are thus misleading unless one compares like-sized journals or adjusts for these effects. We propose the Φ index, a rescaled IF that accounts for size effects, and which can be readily generalized to account also for different citation practices across research fields. Our methodology applies to other citation averages that are used to compare research fields, university departments or countries in various types of rankings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, understanding of how the institutions collaborate and compete in science is sorely lacking, especially in emerging fields. Artificial intelligence is such a booming field currently, changing the way we live and work daily. To illustrate the problem, we try to reveal the evolution of institutional collaboration and competition in artificial intelligence by applying AI 2000 from the perspective of Science of Science. In this paper, we make multiple multidimensional statistical analyses by scrutinizing the collaboration network, research interests, talent flow, etc. We demonstrate the collaboration evolution in this field and find the advantage of inter-institutional collaboration is growing over time for papers that have been published more than 5 years. We discover the common cooperation modes of top institutions and visualize their closer cooperation. We highlight the critical resources competition among institutions in three dimensions and learn the recent trends in the field. In particular, we are concerned about the competition among institutions for cross-industry cooperation and notice the consistency of competitiveness and cross-industry collaboration. The research of this paper may support further research studies on institutional collaboration and competition as well as policy proposals for promoting scientific innovation, research management, and funding. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The policy debate around researchers’ geographic mobility has been moving away from a theorized zero-sum game in which countries can be winners (“brain gain”) or losers (“brain drain”), and toward the concept of “brain circulation,” which implies that researchers move in and out of countries and everyone benefits. Quantifying trends in researchers’ movements is key to understanding the drivers of the mobility of talent, as well as the implications of these patterns for the global system of science, and for the competitive advantages of individual countries. Existing studies have investigated bilateral flows of researchers. However, in order to understand migration systems, determining the extent to which researchers have worked in more than two countries is essential. This study focuses on the subgroup of highly mobile researchers whom we refer to as “peripatetic researchers” or “super-movers.” More specifically, our aim is to track the international movements of researchers who have published in more than two countries through changes in the main affiliation addresses of over 62 million publications indexed in the Web of Science database over the 1956–2016 period. Using this approach, we have established a longitudinal dataset on the international movements of highly mobile researchers across all subject categories, and in all disciplines of scholarship. This article contributes to the literature by offering for the first time a snapshot of the key features of highly mobile researchers, including their patterns of migration and return migration by academic age, the relative frequency of their disciplines, and the relative frequency of their countries of origin and destination. Among other findings, the results point to the emergence of a global system that includes the USA and China as two large hubs, and England and Germany as two smaller hubs for highly mobile researchers. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Since the relaunch of Microsoft Academic Services (MAS) 4 years ago, scholarly communications have undergone dramatic changes: more ideas are being exchanged online, more authors are sharing their data, and more software tools used to make discoveries and reproduce the results are being distributed openly. The sheer amount of information available is overwhelming for individual humans to keep up and digest. In the meantime, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made great strides and the cost of computing has plummeted to the extent that it has become practical to employ intelligent agents to comprehensively collect and analyze scholarly communications. MAS is one such effort and this paper describes its recent progresses since the last disclosure. As there are plenty of independent studies affirming the effectiveness of MAS, this paper focuses on the use of three key AI technologies that underlies its prowess in capturing scholarly communications with adequate quality and broad coverage: (1) natural language understanding in extracting factoids from individual articles at the web scale, (2) knowledge assisted inference and reasoning in assembling the factoids into a knowledge graph, and (3) a reinforcement learning approach to assessing scholarly importance for entities participating in scholarly communications, called the saliency, that serves both as an analytic and a predictive metric in MAS. These elements enhance the capabilities of MAS in supporting the studies of science of science based on the GOTO principle, i.e., good and open data with transparent and objective methodologies. The current direction of development and how to access the regularly updated data and tools from MAS, including the knowledge graph, a REST API and a website, are also described.

Equally evident is the need to allocate resources, both monetary and human, in an effective way to foster innovation [6.1, 6.2]. In the preceding decades, science policy has embraced data mining and metrics to gain insights into the structure and evolution of science and to devise metrics and indicators [6.3], but it has not invested significant efforts into mathematical, statistical, and computational models that can predict future developments in science, technology, and innovation (science, technology, and innovation (STI)) in support of data-driven decision making. Recent advances in computational power combined with the unprecedented volume and variety of data concerning science and technology developments (e. g., publications, patents, funding, clinical trials, and stock market and social media data) yielded ideal conditions for the advancement of computational modeling approaches that can be not only empirically validated, but used to simulate and understand the structure and dynamics of STI in support of improved human decision making. In this chapter, we review and demonstrate the power of computational models for simulating and predicting possible STI developments and futures. In addition, we discuss novel means to visualize and broadcast STI forecasts to make them more accessible to general audiences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Background: Public research funding agencies and research organisations are increasingly accountable for the wider impacts of the research they support. While research impact assessment (RIA) frameworks and tools exist, little is known and shared of how these organisations implement RIA activities in practice. Methods: We conducted a review of academic literature to search for research organisations' published experiences of RIAs. We followed this with semi-structured interviews from a convenience sample (n = 7) of representatives of four research organisations deploying strategies to support and assess research impact. Results: We found only five studies reporting empirical evidence on how research organisations put RIA principles into practice. From our interviews, we observed a disconnect between published RIA frameworks and tools, and the realities of organisational practices, which tended not to be reported. We observed varying maturity and readiness with respect to organisations' structural set ups for conducting RIAs, particularly relating to leadership, skills for evaluation and automating RIA data collection. Key processes for RIA included efforts to engage researcher communities to articulate and plan for impact, using a diversity of methods, frameworks and indicators, and supporting a learning approach. We observed outcomes of RIAs as having supported a dialogue to orient research to impact, underpinned shared learning from analyses of research, and provided evidence of the value of research in different domains and to different audiences. Conclusions: Putting RIA principles and frameworks into practice is still in early stages for research organisations. We recommend that organisations (1) get set up by considering upfront the resources, time and leadership required to embed impact strategies throughout the organisation and wider research 'ecosystem', and develop methodical approaches to assessing impact; (2) work together by engaging researcher communities and wider stakeholders as a core part of impact pathway planning and subsequent assessment; and (3) recognise the benefits that RIA can bring about as a means to improve mutual understanding of the research process between different actors with an interest in research. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background. The 2010 reform of the Italian university system introduced the National Scientific Habilitation (ASN) as a requirement for applying to permanent professor positions. Since the CVs of the 59,149 candidates and the results of their assessments have been made publicly available, the ASN constitutes an opportunity to perform analyses about a nation-wide evaluation process. Objective. The main goals of this paper are: (i) predicting the ASN results using the information contained in the candidates’ CVs; (ii) identifying a small set of quantitative indicators that can be used to perform accurate predictions. Approach. Semantic technologies are used to extract, systematize and enrich the information contained in the applicants’ CVs, and machine learning methods are used to predict the ASN results and to identify a subset of relevant predictors. Results. For predicting the success in the role of associate professor, our best models using all and the top 15 predictors make accurate predictions (F-measure values higher than 0.6) in 88% and 88.6% of the cases, respectively. Similar results have been achieved for the role of full professor. Evaluation. The proposed approach outperforms the other models developed to predict the results of researchers’ evaluation procedures. Conclusions. Such results allow the development of an automated system for supporting both candidates and committees in the future ASN sessions and other scholars’ evaluation procedures.

	abstract = {As the field of neuroimaging grows, it can be difficult for scientists within the field to gain and maintain a detailed understanding of its ever-changing landscape. While collaboration and citation networks highlight important contributions within the field, the roles of and relations among specific areas of study can remain quite opaque. Here, we apply techniques from network science to map the landscape of neuroimaging research documented in the journal NeuroImage over the past decade. We create a network in which nodes represent research topics, and edges give the degree to which these topics tend to be covered in tandem. The network displays small-world architecture, with communities characterized by common imaging modalities and medical applications, and with hubs that integrate these distinct subfields. Using node-level analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among topics related to psychiatry. The overall prevalence of a topic is unrelated to the prevalence of its neighbors, but the degree to which a topic becomes more or less popular over time is strongly related to changes in the prevalence of its neighbors. Finally, we incorporate data from PNAS to investigate whether it serves as a trend-setter for topics’ use within NeuroImage. We find that popularity trends are correlated across the two journals, and that changes in popularity tend to occur earlier within PNAS among growing topics. Broadly, this work presents a cohesive model for understanding the emergent relationships and dynamics of research topics within NeuroImage. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Finding dense bipartite subgraphs and detecting the relations among them is an important problem for affiliation networks that arise in a range of domains, such as social network analysis, word-document clustering, the science of science, internet advertising, and bioinformatics. However, most dense subgraph discovery algorithms are designed for classic, unipartite graphs. Subsequently, studies on affiliation networks are conducted on the co-occurrence graphs (e.g., co-author and co-purchase) that project the bipartite structure to a unipartite structure by connecting two entities if they share an affiliation. Despite their convenience, co-occurrence networks come at a cost of loss of information and an explosion in graph sizes, which limit the quality and the efficiency of solutions. We study the dense subgraph discovery problem on bipartite graphs. We define a framework of bipartite subgraphs based on the butterfly motif (2,2-biclique) to model the dense regions in a hierarchical structure. We introduce efficient peeling algorithms to find the dense subgraphs and build relations among them. We can identify denser structures compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on co-occurrence graphs in real-world data. Our analyses on an author-paper network and a user-product network yield interesting subgraphs and hierarchical relations such as the groups of collaborators in the same institution and spammers that give fake ratings. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Modern advances in transportation and communication technology from airplanes to the internet alongside global expansions of media, migration, and trade have made the modern world more connected than ever before. But what does this bode for the convergence of global culture? Here we explore the relationship between centralization in social networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity of semantic expressions such as ideas, opinions and tastes. We advance formal examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations into comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively represent both hierarchy and diversity within a system. In a Poincaré disk—a two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding—radius from center traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a semantic hierarchy. Angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors or ideas captures their diversity. We illustrate this method by examining the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense, centralized collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of ideas and how these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and science. We discuss the complex of causes underlying this association, and theorize the dynamic interplay between structural centralization and semantic contraction, arguing that it introduces an essential tension between the supply and demand of difference. © 2019},

	abstract = {Collaboration among researchers plays an important role in scientific discoveries, especially in multidisciplinary research. How to allocate credit reasonably to coauthors of a paper is a long-standing problem in the science of sciences. The collective credit allocation method (CCA method) proposed by Shen, H. W. and Barabási, A. L. provides a novel view to solve this problem, which measures the coauthors’ contribution to a paper based on the citation process by the scientific community. Nevertheless, the existing collective allocation method assigns equal weights to citing papers, which is sensitive to the malicious manipulation. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear collective credit allocation method (NCCA method) that assigns different strength to citing papers according to papers’ scientific impact when measuring papers’ similarity. Compared to the CCA method, we find that the NCCA method assigns more credits to Nobel laureates in the Nobel-winning papers. Moreover, the NCCA method is robust against random perturbations and the malicious manipulation in both Nobel-prize papers and ordinary papers. Furthermore, the collective credit allocation method can also modify h index. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {There is extensive, yet fragmented, evidence of gender differences in academia suggesting that women are underrepresented in most scientific disciplines and publish fewer articles throughout a career, and their work acquires fewer citations. Here, we offer a comprehensive picture of longitudinal gender differences in performance through a bibliometric analysis of academic publishing careers by reconstructing the complete publication history of over 1.5 million gender-identified authors whose publishing career ended between 1955 and 2010, covering 83 countries and 13 disciplines. We find that, paradoxically, the increase of participation of women in science over the past 60 years was accompanied by an increase of gender differences in both productivity and impact. Most surprisingly, though, we uncover two gender invariants, finding that men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and have equivalent career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we demonstrate that differences in publishing career lengths and dropout rates explain a large portion of the reported career-wise differences in productivity and impact, although productivity differences still remain. This comprehensive picture of gender inequality in academia can help rephrase the conversation around the sustainability of women's careers in academia, with important consequences for institutions and policy makers. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Over the course of history, a relatively small fraction of individuals have made disproportionate, profound, and lasting impacts on science and society. Despite a long-standing interest in the careers of scientific elites across diverse disciplines, it remains difficult to collect large-scale career histories that could serve as training sets for systematic empirical and theoretical studies. Here, by combining unstructured data collected from CVs, university websites, and Wikipedia, together with the publication and citation database from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), we reconstructed publication histories of nearly all Nobel prize winners from the past century, through both manual curation and algorithmic disambiguation procedures. Data validation shows that the collected dataset presents among the most comprehensive collection of publication records for Nobel laureates currently available. As our quantitative understanding of science deepens, this dataset is expected to have increasing value. It will not only allow us to quantitatively probe novel patterns of productivity, collaboration, and impact governing successful scientific careers, it may also help us unearth the fundamental principles underlying creativity and the genesis of scientific breakthroughs. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The exponential increase in the number of scientific publications raises the question of whether the sciences are expanding into a fractured structure, making cross-field communication difficult. On the other hand, scientists may be motivated to learn extensively across fields to enhance their innovative capacity, and this may offset the negative effects of fragmentation. Through an investigation of the distances within and clustering of cross-sectional citation networks, this study presents evidence that fields of science become more integrated over time. The average citation distance between papers published in the same year decreased from ~5.33 to 3.18 steps between 1950 and 2018. This observation is attributed to the growth of cross-field communication throughout the entire period as well as the growing importance of high-impact papers to bridge networks in the same year. Three empirical findings support this conclusion. First, distances decreased between almost all disciplines throughout the time period. Second, inequality in the number of citations received by papers increased, and, as a consequence, the shortest paths in the network depend more on high-impact papers later in the period. Third, the dispersion of connections between fields increased continually. Moreover, these changes did not entail a lower level of clustering of citations. Both within- and cross-field citations show a similar rate of slowly growing clustering values in all years. The latter findings suggest that domain-spanning scholarly communication is partly enabled by new fields that connect disciplines. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

These fundamental papers initiated a new era of research establishing an interdisciplinary field called network science. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the field, a diverse but not divided network science community has emerged in the past 20 years. This paper honors the contributions of network science by exploring the evolution of this community as seen through the growing co-authorship network of network scientists (here the notion refers to a scholar with at least one paper citing at least one of the three aforementioned milestone papers). After investigating various characteristics of 29,528 network science papers, we construct the co-authorship network of 52,406 network scientists and we analyze its topology and dynamics. We shed light on the collaboration patterns of the last 20 years of network science by investigating numerous structural properties of the co-authorship network and by using enhanced data visualization techniques. We also identify the most central authors, the largest communities, investigate the spatiotemporal changes, and compare the properties of the network to scientometric indicators. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Scientific prizes confer credibility to persons, ideas, and disciplines, provide financial incentives, and promote community-building celebrations. We examine the growth dynamics and interlocking relationships found in the worldwide scientific prize network. We focus on understanding how the knowledge linkages among prizes and scientists’ propensities for prizewinning relate to knowledge pathways between disciplines and stratification within disciplines. Our data cover more than 3,000 different scientific prizes in diverse disciplines and the career histories of 10,455 prizewinners worldwide for over 100 years. We find several key links between prizes and scientific advances. First, despite an explosive proliferation of prizes over time and across the globe, prizes are more concentrated within a relatively small group of scientific elites, and ties among elites are highly clustered, suggesting that a relatively constrained number of ideas and scholars push the boundaries of science. For example, 64.1% of prizewinners have won two prizes and 13.7% have won five or more prizes. Second, certain prizes strongly interlock disciplines and subdisciplines, creating key pathways by which knowledge spreads and is recognized across science. Third, genealogical and coauthorship networks predict who wins multiple prizes, which helps to explain the interconnectedness among celebrated scientists and their pathbreaking ideas. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The evolution in AI has advanced the development of human society in our own time, with dramatic revolutions shaped by both theories and techniques. However, the multidisciplinary and fast-growing features make AI a field in which it is difficult to be well understood. In this paper, we study the evolution of AI at the beginning of the 21st century using publication metadata extracted from 9 top-tier journals and 12 top-tier conferences of this discipline. We find that the area is in the sustainable development and its impact continues to grow. From the perspective of reference behavior, the decrease in self-references indicates that the AI is becoming more and more open-minded. The influential papers/researchers/institutions we identified outline landmarks in the development of this field. Last but not least, we explore the inner structure in terms of topics' evolution over time. We have quantified the temporal trends at the topic level and discovered the inner connection among these topics. These findings provide deep insights into the current scientific innovations, as well as shedding light on funding policies. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {According to a recent survey, ecologists and evolutionary biologists feel that theoretical and empirical research should coexist in a tight feedback loop but believe that the two domains actually interact very little. We evaluate this perception using a citation network analysis for two data sets, representing the literature on sexual selection and speciation. Overall, 54%–60% of citations come from a paper’s own category, whereas 17%–23% are citations across categories. These cross-citations tend to focus on highly cited papers, and we observe a positive correlation between the numbers of citations a study receives within and across categories. We find evidence that reviews can function as integrators between the two literatures, argue that theoretical models are analogous to specific empirical study systems, and complement our analyses by studying a cocitation network. We conclude that theoretical and empirical research are more tightly connected than generally thought but that avenues exist to further increase this integration. © The Author(s) 2018.

From nowadays prospects it looks very well grounded as soon as in Leibniz's manuscripts a modern scholar finds clue ideas of any research field which would tempt him to consider Leibniz as one of the founders of this particular discipline. We argue that this is possible only in retrospection and would significantly distort the essence of Leibniz's epistemology. Our approach implies, in contrary, the investigation of the Leibniz doctrine of signs on the background of the related philosophical problem, that of expression. The choice of semiotics is justified by the fact that it took a central place in his theoretical constructions, both those of natural sciences and of philosophy. In Leibniz system of knowledge the concept of notes (notae) and sings (signa) served a theoretical foundation of his most important and long-life aspiration to build up practical science of universal characteristics (characteristica universalis). In his eyes this practical science was the science of sciences (Scientia scientiarum), and we can consider it as the matrix for all possible scientific knowledge. © 2020 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

	abstract = {Scientific knowledge constitutes a complex system that has recently been the topic of in-depth analysis. Empirical evidence reveals that little is known about the dynamic aspects of human knowledge. Precise dissection of the expansion of scientific knowledge could help us to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of science. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic properties and growth principles of the MEDLINE bibliographic database using network analysis methodology. The basic assumption of this work is that the scientific evolution of the life sciences can be represented as a list of co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors that are linked to MEDLINE citations. The MEDLINE database was summarized as a complex system, consisting of nodes and edges, where the nodes refer to knowledge concepts and the edges symbolize corresponding relations. We performed an extensive statistical evaluation based on more than 25 million citations in the MEDLINE database, from 1966 until 2014. We based our analysis on node and community level in order to track temporal evolution in the network. The degree distribution of the network follows a stretched exponential distribution which prevents the creation of large hubs. Results showed that the appearance of new MeSH terms does not also imply new connections. The majority of new connections among nodes results from old MeSH descriptors. We suggest a wiring mechanism based on the theory of structural holes, according to which a novel scientific discovery is established when a connection is built among two or more previously disconnected parts of scientific knowledge. Overall, we extracted 142 different evolving communities. It is evident that new communities are constantly born, live for some time, and then die. We also provide a Web-based application that helps characterize and understand the content of extracted communities. This study clearly shows that the evolution of MEDLINE knowledge correlates with the network's structural and temporal characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Assessing scholarly influence is critical for understanding the collective system of scholarship and the history of academic inquiry. Influence is multifaceted, and citations reveal only part of it. Citation counts exhibit preferential attachment and follow a rigid “news cycle” that can miss sustained and indirect forms of influence. Building on dynamic topic models that track distributional shifts in discourse over time, we introduce a variant that incorporates features, such as authorship, affiliation, and publication venue, to assess how these contexts interact with content to shape future scholarship. We perform in-depth analyses on collections of physics research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally (JSTOR repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such as winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked institution, boost influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive influence reveals that citations tend to credit authors who persist in their fields over time and discount credit for works that are influential over many topics or are “ahead of their time.” In this way, our measures provide a way to acknowledge diverse contributions that take longer and travel farther to achieve scholarly appreciation, enabling us to correct citation biases and enhance sensitivity to the full spectrum of scholarly impact. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Omnia in mensura et numero et pondere disposuisti is a famous Latin phrase from Solomon's Book of Wisdom, dated to the mid first century BC, meaning that all things were ordered in measure, number, and weight. Naturally, the wisdom is appearing in its relation to man. The Wisdom of Solomon is understood as the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. Consequently, a natural and obvious conjecture is that measurement science is the science of sciences. In fact, it is a basis of all experimental and theoretical research activities. Each measuring process assumes an object of measurement. Some science disciplines, such as quantum physics, are still incomprehensible despite complex mathematical interpretations. No phenomenon is a real phenomenon unless it is observable in space and time, that is, unless it is a subject to measurement. The science of measurement is an indispensable ingredient in all scientific fields. Mathematical foundations and interpretation of the measurement science were accepted and further developed in most of the scientific fields, including physics, cosmology, geology, environment, quantum mechanics, statistics, and metrology. In this year, 2020, Measurement Science Review celebrates its 20th anniversary and we are using this special opportunity to highlight the importance of measurement science and to express our faith that the journal will continue to be an excellent place for exchanging bright ideas in the field of measurement science. As an illustration and motivation for usage and further development of mathematical methods in measurement science, we briefly present the simple least squares method, frequently used for measurement evaluation, and its possible modification. The modified least squares estimation method was applied and experimentally tested for magnetic field homogeneity adjustment. © 2020 Viktor Witkovský et al., published by Sciendo.},

Despite long-standing, multi-disciplinary interests in understanding careers of elite scientists, there have been limited attempts for a quantitative, career-level analysis. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset we assembled, allowing us to trace the entire career histories of nearly all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine over the past century. We find that, although Nobel laureates were energetic producers from the outset, producing works that garner unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize follow relatively similar patterns to those of ordinary scientists, being characterized by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations. We also uncovered notable variations along their careers, often associated with the Nobel Prize, including shifting coauthorship structure in the prize-winning work, and a significant but temporary dip in the impact of work they produce after winning the Nobel Prize. Together, these results document quantitative patterns governing the careers of scientific elites, offering an empirical basis for a deeper understanding of the hallmarks of exceptional careers in science. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Instead, Adolf Reinach in The Apriori Foundations of the Civil Law defines the notion of norm as polysemantic and distinguishes the legal provisions (the prescriptive sentences), formulated within a given community, from the basic norms which are grounded in the objective (including moral) justness of the states of affairs. The obligation of the being and the obligation of acting exist in themselves, independently from cognition. In turn, “enactments and the propositions which express enactments” as a kind of normative sentences have the character of normalisation, but they require a person to pronounce them. The prescriptions realise and refer to what is objectively being and to the objectivity of what is being and obligatory. In my text, I present Reinach's position on the relations between norms and provisions (as prescriptive propositions “which express enactments”) referring his theories to the Husserlian concept of normativity. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {In the fast-growing scholarly big data background, social network technologies have recently aroused widespread attention in academia and industry. The concept of academic social networks is created precisely in the context of scholarly big data, which refers to the complicated academic network formed by academic entities and their relationships. There are a wealth of scholarly big data processing methods to analyze the rich structural types and related information about academic social networks. Nowadays, various academic data can be easily obtained, which makes it easier for us to analyze and study academic social networks. This study investigates the background, the current status, and trends of academic social networks. We first elaborate on the concept of academic social networks and related research background. Secondly, we analyze models based on nodes’ types and timeliness. Thirdly, we review analytical methods, including relevant metrics, network properties, and available academic analysis tools. Furthermore, we sort out some key mining technologies for academic social networks. Finally, we systematically review representative research tasks in this domain from three levels: actor, relationship, and network. In addition, some academic social networking sites are presented. This survey concludes with the current challenges and open issues. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore it is crucial to understand the relationships between scientific impact and online demand and supply for information about scientists and their work. In this paper, we compare the temporal pattern of information supply (article creations) and information demand (article views) on Wikipedia for two groups of scientists: scientists who received one of the most prestigious awards in their field and influential scientists from the same field who did not receive an award. Our research highlights that awards function as external shocks which increase supply and demand for information about scientists, but hardly affect information supply and demand for their research topics. Further, we find interesting differences in the temporal ordering of information supply between the two groups: (i) award-winners have a higher probability that interest in them precedes interest in their work; (ii) for award winners interest in articles about them and their work is temporally more clustered than for non-awarded scientists. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: Translational science aims at "translating" basic scientific discoveries into clinical applications. The identification of translational science has practicality such as evaluating the effectiveness of investments made into large programs like the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. Despite several proposed methods that group publications - the primary unit of research output - into some categories, we still lack a quantitative way to place articles onto the full, continuous spectrum from basic research to clinical medicine. Materials and Methods: I learn vector representations of controlled vocabularies assigned to Medline articles to obtain a translational axis that points from basic science to clinical medicine. The projected position of a term on the translational axis, expressed by a continuous quantity, indicates the term's "appliedness." The position of an article, determined by the average location over its terms, quantifies the degree of its appliedness, which I term the level score. Results: I validate the present method by comparing with previous techniques, showing excellent agreement yet uncovering significant variations of scores of articles in previously defined categories. The measure allows us to characterize the standing of journals, disciplines, and the entire biomedical literature along the basicapplied spectrum. Analysis on large-scale citation network reveals 2 main findings. First, direct citations mainly occurred between articles with similar scores. Second, shortest paths are more likely ended up with an article closer to the basic end of the spectrum, regardless of where the starting article is on the spectrum. Conclusions: The proposed method provides a quantitative way to identify translational science. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Two fundamentally different perspectives on knowledge diffusion dominate debates about academic disciplines. On the one hand, critics of disciplinary research and education have argued that disciplines are isolated silos, within which specialists pursue inward-looking and increasingly narrow research agendas. On the other hand, critics of the silo argument have demonstrated that researchers constantly import and export ideas across disciplinary boundaries. These perspectives have different implications for how knowledge diffuses, how intellectuals gain and lose status within their disciplines, and how intellectual reputations evolve within and across disciplines. We argue that highly general claims about the nature of disciplinary boundaries are counterproductive, and that research on the nature of specific disciplinary boundaries is more useful. To that end, this paper uses a novel publication and citation network dataset and statistical models of citation networks to test hypotheses about the boundaries between philosophy of science and 11 disciplinary clusters. Specifically, we test hypotheses about whether engaging with and being cited by scientific communities outside philosophy of science has an impact on one’s position within philosophy of science. Our results suggest that philosophers of science produce interdisciplinary scholarship, but they tend not to cite work by other philosophers when it is published in journals outside of their discipline. Furthermore, net of other factors, receiving citations from other disciplines has no meaningful impact—positive or negative—on citations within philosophy of science. We conclude by considering this evidence for simultaneous interdisciplinarity and insularity in terms of scientific trading theory and other work on disciplinary boundaries and communication. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Scientists must share their work with the public in order to promote science-based public discourse and policies. These acts of science communication are often evaluated in terms of their ability to inform (i.e., introduce accurate and accessible information) and engage (i.e., capture interest and maintain attention). We focus on a third basis by which science communication might be judged, influence. Science communicators exert influence when they shape public opinions in ways that affect their judgments and decisions, alter social and political discourse and debate, and guide social policy. We describe how the influence of any given science communication should be evaluated independent of its ability to inform or engage. We give particular attention in our analysis to the often unintended influences that well-meaning science communicators can have. We begin by considering ways that communications from climate scientists might reduce support for climate regulation and communications from health scientists might undermine public health. We then develop two “case studies,” drawn from social psychology. These show how popular media descriptions of the science of racial bias and disadvantage might in some cases exacerbate racial discrimination and reduce concern for the disadvantaged. We close with an agenda for a more vigorous science of science communication; one that engages in two complementary pursuits. Critical studies identify the dominant and consequential effects that popular science communicators are having on public perceptions. Strategic studies advance and empirically test communication strategies that scientists can pursue to reduce—rather than exacerbate—social problems. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues},

	abstract = {Understanding, monitoring, and predicting the flow of knowledge between academia and industry is of critical importance for a variety of stakeholders, including governments, funding bodies, researchers, investors, and companies. To this purpose, we introduce ResearchFlow, an approach that integrates semantic technologies and machine learning to quantifying the diachronic behaviour of research topics across academia and industry. ResearchFlow exploits the novel Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph in order to characterize each topic according to the frequency in time of the related i) publications from academia, ii) publications from industry, iii) patents from academia, and iv) patents from industry. This representation is then used to produce several analytics regarding the academia/industry knowledge flow and to forecast the impact of research topics on industry. We applied ResearchFlow to a dataset of 3.5M papers and 2M patents in Computer Science and highlighted several interesting patterns. We found that 89.8% of the topics first emerge in academic publications, which typically precede industrial publications by about 5.6 years and industrial patents by about 6.6 years. However this does not mean that academia always dictates the research agenda. In fact, our analysis also shows that industrial trends tend to influence academia more than academic trends affect industry. We evaluated ResearchFlow on the task of forecasting the impact of research topics on the industrial sector and found that its granular characterization of topics improves significantly the performance with respect to alternative solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Background The academic publishing world is changing significantly, with ever-growing numbers of publications each year and shifting publishing patterns. However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart's Law, according to which, "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Results In this study, we analyzed >120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal's impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As governments, funding agencies and research organisations worldwide seek to maximise both the financial and non-financial returns on investment in research, the way the research process is organised and funded is becoming increasingly under scrutiny. There are growing demands and aspirations to measure research impact (beyond academic publications), to understand how science works, and to optimise its societal and economic impact. In response, a multidisciplinary practice called research impact assessment is rapidly developing. Given that the practice is still in its formative stage, systematised recommendations or accepted standards for practitioners (such as funders and those responsible for managing research projects) across countries or disciplines to guide research impact assessment are not yet available. In this statement, we propose initial guidelines for a rigorous and effective process of research impact assessment applicable to all research disciplines and oriented towards practice. This statement systematises expert knowledge and practitioner experience from designing and delivering the International School on Research Impact Assessment (ISRIA). It brings together insights from over 450 experts and practitioners from 34 countries, who participated in the school during its 5-year run (from 2013 to 2017) and shares a set of core values from the school's learning programme. These insights are distilled into ten-point guidelines, which relate to (1) context, (2) purpose, (3) stakeholders' needs, (4) stakeholder engagement, (5) conceptual frameworks, (6) methods and data sources, (7) indicators and metrics, (8) ethics and conflicts of interest, (9) communication, and (10) community of practice. The guidelines can help practitioners improve and standardise the process of research impact assessment, but they are by no means exhaustive and require evaluation and continuous improvement. The prima facie effectiveness of the guidelines is based on the systematised expert and practitioner knowledge of the school's faculty and participants derived from their practical experience and research evidence. The current knowledge base has gaps in terms of the geographical and scientific discipline as well as stakeholder coverage and representation. The guidelines can be further strengthened through evaluation and continuous improvement by the global research impact assessment community. © 2018 The Author(s).},

It introduces the work currently being done by a community of scholars who have taken Hakob Barseghyan’s The Laws of Scientific Change as a starting point and the theoretical basis for an empirical science of science named scientonomy. A fundamental strength of Barseghyan’s work is that it offers a compelling historical hypothesis for why HS and PS are unintegrated, and crafts a theory of scientific change that explicitly redresses the causes of this unintegration. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Emily Herring, Kevin Matthew Jones, Konstantin S.

At the same time, the complexity and dynamics of IS raise the challenge for exploring the topic in detail. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis on bibliographic dataset to reveal the evolution of information systems in 2 decades (1996–2015). We select 39,767 papers published in 8 top-tier journals and conferences between 1996 and 2015 and explore the anatomy from manifold. We find that IS is experiencing the sustainable growth phase in terms of increased productivity, impact, and collaboration. The field is benefited from collaborative, open-minded, and in-depth efforts evidenced from the growing number of co-authors per paper, the continual declining of self-citation rate, and increased reference age, respectively. By applying topic detection models on paper titles, abstracts, and keywords, we infer the representative topics and research directions, which can also reveal the research landscape within this field. Finally, we measure the temporal trends of topics and identify the innovative years in the 20 years’ development history of IS. These discoveries can benefit not only researchers in terms of promoting understanding of the entire field, but also governments for funding agencies. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

These massive data and processing methodologies have given rise to an exciting new field, namely Science of Science (SoS) as the successor of what is called scientometrics or informetrics for many decades. Science of Science is the offspring of the fertile cooperation of many disciplines, such as network science, statistics, machine learning, mathematical analysis, sociology of science and so on. In this article, we provide a comprehensive coverage of recent advances in SoS related to network analysis, prediction and ranking, and investigate the issue of scientist ranking from a multilayer network perspective. Towards this goal, we contrast by experiments the well-known h-index and the recently proposed indicator C3-index to a generalization of PageRank for multilayer networks, namely BiPlex PageRank, which is based on solid tensor analysis. Both the obtained results and the brief survey of SoS will deepen our faith to SoS and stimulate further efforts in this transdisciplinary field. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Scientific inquiry, like all other human activity, cannot be separated from the humans conducting the inquiry. While public discourse often treats science as sacrosanct and scientists as devoid of any but the purest motives, the science of science literature has long understood scientific inquiry as a fundamentally social activity undertaken by self-interested, partial, human choosers with limited information (Polanyi in Minerva 1(1):54–73, 1962; Kuhn in The structure of scientific revolutions. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 1962; Leonard in J Econ Methodol 9(2):141–168, 2002). In this essay, we review the assumptions of two of the original contributions to the science of science literature regarding human agents and compare them to the assumptions underlying economic models. We assert that Michael Polanyi and Thomas Kuhn did for the science of science literature what Buchanan and Tullock (The calculus of consent: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy. Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1962) did for politics in the 1950s, which is to reassert behavioral symmetry. We then extend some of Buchanan’s insights from his study of politics and constitutions, public choice and constitutional political economy, to the study of science and draw out implications for interest-group influence in the republic of science. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Following small-group discussions, the working groups presented their findings, and participants discussed the research opportunities identified. The investigators compiled a list of research priorities, which were circulated to all participants for feedback. Results: Participants identified the following priority research questions: (1) Can RRT-focused statistics and mathematical modeling courses improve statistics practice?; (2) Can specialized training in scientific writing improve transparency?; (3) Does modality (e.g. face to face, online) affect the efficacy RRT-related education?; (4) How can automated programs help identify errors more efficiently?; (5) What is the prevalence and impact of errors in scientific publications (e.g., analytic inconsistencies, statistical errors, and other objective errors)?; (6) Do error prevention workflows reduce errors?; (7) How do we encourage post-publication error correction?; (8) How does 'spin' in research communication affect stakeholder understanding and use of research evidence?; (9) Do tools to aid writing research reports increase comprehensiveness and clarity of research reports?; and (10) Is it possible to inculcate scientific values and norms related to truthful, rigorous, accurate, and comprehensive scientific reporting? Conclusion: Participants identified important and relatively unexplored questions related to improving RRT. This list may be useful to the scientific community and investigators seeking to advance meta-science (i.e. research on research). © 2020 Valdez D et al.},

	abstract = {Experience plays a critical role in crafting high-impact scientific work. This is particularly evident in top multidisciplinary journals, where a scientist is unlikely to appear as senior author if he or she has not previously published within the same journal. Here, we develop a quantitative understanding of author order by quantifying this “chaperone effect,” capturing how scientists transition into senior status within a particular publication venue. We illustrate that the chaperone effect has a different magnitude for journals in different branches of science, being more pronounced in medical and biological sciences and weaker in natural sciences. Finally, we show that in the case of high-impact venues, the chaperone effect has significant implications, specifically resulting in a higher average impact relative to papers authored by new principal investigators (PIs). Our findings shed light on the role played by experience in publishing within specific scientific journals, on the paths toward acquiring the necessary experience and expertise, and on the skills required to publish in prestigious venues. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

With the volume of research growing exponentially every year, conducting meta-analyses can be costly and inefficient, as a significant amount of time and human efforts needs to be spent in finding studies meeting research criteria, annotating them, and properly performing the statistical analyses to summarise the findings. In this work, we show these issues can be tackled with semantic representations and technologies, using a social science scenario as case-study. We show how the domain-specific content of research outputs can be represented and used to facilitate their search, analysis and synthesis. We present the very first representation of the domain of human cooperation, and the application we built on top of this to help experts in performing meta-analyses semi-automatically. Using few application scenarios, we show how our approach supports the various phases meta-analyses, and more in general contributes towards research replication and automated hypotheses generation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary studies of science form a “living” organism, in which every part performs its function and is connected with other parts. Philosophy of science plays a role of the “think-tank” of that organism. It is a generator of the sense that connects the functions of its separate parts into a systematic unity. It can be called the consciousness of science. Metaphilosophy of science is related to philosophy of science in the same way as philosophy of science itself is related to science. Within metaphilosophy of science the propensity of philosophy of science to self-reflection is implemented. Metaphilosophy of science makes relevant the issues that relate to the philosophical significance of the processes taking place in the so-called “trading zone” (in the sense of P. Galison). These trading zone is a place where scientists, science-of-science theorists and philosophers exchange their ideas. The interaction between philosophy and metaphilosophy of science takes place in the course of a competition among various philosophical interpretations of the results received within the studies of these “trading” processes. Institutional, methodological, historical and culturological studies get a philosophical interpretation and become the source of metaphilosophical ideas. Metaphorically, one may say, that metaphilosophy of science is the self-consciousness of philosophy of science. The very idea that metaphilosophy of science is a participant of the process occurring in the “trading zone” puts an end to a meaningless pile of “metalevels” that very often characterize philosophical discussions of science. © 2019 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

	abstract = {The experimental studies presented here investigated whether discussing ethical implications of preliminary scientific results in a science blog would impact blog readers’ perception of the responsible scientist blogger’s epistemic trustworthiness (on the dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence). They also investigated whether it made a difference in who had brought forward the ethics aspects: the responsible scientist blogger or another expert. Results indicate that by the mere introduction of ethics, people infer something about the blogger’s communicative intentions: Introducing ethical aspects seems to raise vigilance about an expert’s benevolence and integrity. Moreover, ratings of epistemic trustworthiness differed depending on who added ethical arguments: If ethics were introduced by the scientist blogger himself, his benevolence and integrity were rated higher than when ethics were introduced by another expert. These results are relevant for science bloggers, science communicators, and researchers who study laypeople’s understanding of epistemic uncertainty within science. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Most uses and investigations of scholarly journals rest on implicit understandings of journals as communication channels which are rarely made explicit, let alone discussed. In this paper, we argue that by theoretically embedding and operationalizing 'internationality', bibliometrics can contribute to the study of social structures of scientific communities. We consider journals as communication channels in the production process of scientific communities and define their internationality as the links they create between community members from different countries. This definition can be operationalised with four sets of variables describing the international composition of the set of authors, the selection processes and their impact on the international composition of the set of authors, the international composition of the journal's audience, and knowledge flows between authors and audiences. We analyse six journals from different regions of the world in the field of International Relations and find that the supposedly 'leading international journals' are in fact closer to being domestic US-journals, while European and Asian journals show a much higher diversity of authors, audiences and editorial boards. We confirm that a differentiated analysis of international diversity contributes to theorydriven investigations of scientific communities. Our approach appears to be transferable to questions about the thematic diversity of journals.},

In this article, we present an emerging perspective on opportunities for such application, at three different levels of the research enterprise. At the cognitive science level of the individual researcher, opportunities include: overcoming idea fixation and sloppy thinking, and balancing divergent and convergent thinking. At the social network level of the research team, opportunities include: overcoming strong links and groupthink, and optimally distributing divergent and convergent thinking between individuals and teams. At the research ecosystem level of the research institution and the larger national and international community of researchers, opportunities include: overcoming performance fixation, overcoming narrow measures of research impact, and overcoming (or harnessing) existential/social stress. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {The Journal of Business and Psychology (JBP) is dedicated to publishing high-quality and impactful research with the ultimate goals of advancing our science of work and organizations (Rogelberg 2009). To promote this end, we examined three years of JBP author, manuscript, and reviewer data in the hopes of gleaning insights into potential drivers of manuscript quality and publication success for authorship teams. Although the great majority of research in the organizational sciences is conducted in teams (Acedo et al. 2006; Wuchty et al. 2007), an extensive literature review revealed scant empirical work investigating team factors related to manuscript quality. This opportunity prompted a collaborative effort between the Journal of Business and Psychology and the Journal of Management to conduct a parallel study of author team composition, decisions, activities, and manuscript quality. The goal of this collaboration is to start a multi-faceted conversation around potential avenues for current and future authors to promote scholarly impact in their research. This paper focuses on small research/authorship teams, comprised of two, three, or four members, who have submitted papers to Journal of Business and Psychology. We examine a number of team factors, such as team composition and experiential resources, team communication, and team publication-related development activities prior to submitting the paper for publication. For each of these areas, we assess how they relate to both overall reviewer ratings of quality and editor decisions. Using a reflective inductive approach, we highlight and discuss the most interesting findings. Finally, after discussing our limitations, we offer suggestions for future research directions around the domain of the science of organizational scholarship with the goal of encouraging such submissions to the Journal of Business and Psychology. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Despite demonstrating high accuracy on benchmarks, they reproduce the external classification for many real-world systems with a significant level of discrepancy. A widely accepted reason behind such outcome is the unavoidable loss of non-topological information (such as node attributes) encountered when the original complex system is converted to a network. In this article we systematically show that the observed discrepancies may also be caused by a different reason: the external classification itself. For this end we use scientific publication data which (i) exhibit a well defined modular structure and (ii) hold an expert-made classification of research articles. Having represented the articles and the extracted scientific concepts both as a bipartite network and as its unipartite projection, we applied modularity optimization to uncover the inner thematic structure. The resulting clusters are shown to partly reflect the author-made classification, although some significant discrepancies are observed. A detailed analysis of these discrepancies shows that they may carry essential information about the system, mainly related to the use of similar techniques and methods across different (sub)disciplines, that is otherwise omitted when only the external classification is considered. © 2016, Palchykov et al.},

While extensive efforts have been devoted to quantifying and predicting research impact, the question of how collaborative behavior influences scientific impact remains unaddressed. In this work, we study the interplay between scientists' collaboration signatures and their scientific impact. As the basis of our study, we employ an ArnetMiner dataset with more than 1.7 million authors and 2 million papers spanning over 60 years. We formally define a scientist's collaboration signature as the distribution of collaboration strengths with each collaborator in his or her academic ego network, which is quantified by four measures: sociability, dependence, diversity, and self-collaboration. We then demonstrate that the collaboration signature allows us to effectively distinguish between researchers with dissimilar levels of scientific impact. We also discover that, even from the early stages of one's researcher career, a scientist's collaboration signature can help to reveal his or her future scientific impact. Finally, we find that as a representative group of outstanding computer scientists, Turing Award winners collectively produce distinctive collaboration signatures throughout the entirety of their careers. Our conclusions on the relationship between collaboration signatures and scientific impact give rise to important implications for researchers who wish to expand their scientific impact and more effectively stand on the shoulders of "collaborators". © 2015 ACM.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone condition that does not often become clinically clear until a fracture occurs. The objective of the current study was to analyze all publications whose titles included the term "postmenopausal osteoporosis" published during the past decade by journals indexed in the database of SCI-E. Methods: This paper analyzes two sets of data: in the first, all papers with "postmenopausal osteoporosis" in their titles indexed in the database of SCI-E in the period 2001-2011; the second, all papers published by Osteoporosis International that were indexed in SCI-E during 2001-2011. The Science of Science Tool was used to map the co-authorship networks of papers published by Osteoporosis International in 2007-2011. Only papers cited more than 100 times in the Web of Science were considered for mapping the co-authorship network. Results: A total number of 2,056 papers with "postmenopausal osteoporosis" in their titles were indexed in SCI-E between 2001 and 2011. The annual number of publications increased during the study period. The majority of publications came from Western Europe and North America. The number of papers published by authors based in Western Europe was about 75% greater than for North America. Conclusion: More papers on postmenopausal osteoporosis were published in Western Europe than in North America. The networks of co-authorship pointed to the strategic positions of highly cited authors from Western Europe. The top eight authors contributing the majority of papers were from Western Europe. Consequently Western Europe had greater impact than North America. © 2014 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

It also suggests that future research develop and test message structures able to neutralize biased processing and also uncover ways to motivate audiences to make accurate rather than distorted judgments about scientific issues. © Oxford University Press 2017.},

Results were taken from our workshop about nature of science (NOS) and science – technology – society (STS) approach at Can Tho University, Vietnam on 20 March 2013. Participants are around 30 Vietnamese lecturers and pre-service teachers of Can Tho university and 32 participants from Khon Kaen University. This workshop was funded by the project of KKU Science Education Mekong Technology Transfer that organized by science education program, Faculty of Education, Khon Kaen University. The purpose of the workshop was to introduce the recently focused education goal about the nature of science of science education worldwide and the STS approach to Vietnamese educators and teachers. This training workshop was conducted based on the constructivist lens where the prior knowledge and experience of the participants were employed to let them construct the concepts of nature of science by themselves through various activities. Reflections and discussion indicated that Vietnamese participants currently have some certain understanding as well as naïve conceptions about the nature of science. Most of the misconceptions were successfully transformed to the informed ones through the workshop except the idea of ‘the function of, and relationship between theory and law’. We also reported here the ineffectiveness of the VNOS-C of Lederman et al. (2002) in collecting Vietnamese conceptions about NOS. We discussed some possible reasons for this unsuccessfulness. Several suggestions for future researches on Vietnamese teachers’ understanding and thinking and for the next training workshops or training programs in Vietnam were made. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.},

Despite decades of policies in gender equity in science, disparities persist along several dimensions. One dimension that has been relatively understudied is the role of funding on gender disparities in science. To address this gap, we provide an historical analysis (1981-2016) of funding, by gender, from the National Science Foundation in the United States. We find that the mean rate of funds received by women is higher than that of men (and has been so since the early 2000s). However, men control the dominant share of funding and fellowships. As a work-in-progress paper, we discuss the extraction and cleaning of the data, provide an initial analysis, and describe the ongoing analysis of these data. The results provide policy makers with a much needed historical lens on progress towards parity, identifying areas of success and areas which require additional efforts in order to fund women at rates equal to their participation in science.},

	abstract = {The science and engineering workforce has aged rapidly in recent years, both in absolute terms and relative to the workforce as a whole. This is a potential concern if the large number of older scientists crowds out younger scientists, making it difficult for them to establish independent careers. In addition, scientists are believed to be most creative earlier in their careers, so the aging of the workforce may slow the pace of scientific progress. We develop and simulate a demographic model, which shows that a substantial majority of recent aging is a result of the aging of the large baby boom cohort of scientists. However, changes in behavior have also played a significant role, in particular, a decline in the retirement rate of older scientists, induced in part by the elimination of mandatory retirement in universities in 1994. Furthermore, the age distribution of the scientific workforce is still adjusting. Current retirement rates and other determinants of employment in science imply a steady-state mean age 2.3 y higher than the 2008 level of 48.6. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output of scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: "Will this paper increase my h-index?" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the topic popularity and the co-authors' hindices are of surprisingly little relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5% potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more effectively leverage their position of "standing on the shoulders of giants."

	abstract = {Science is becoming increasingly more interdisciplinary, giving rise to more diversity in the areas of expertise. In such a complex environment, the participation of authors became more specialized, hampering the task of evaluating authors according to their contributions. While some metrics were adapted to account for the order (or rank) of authors in a paper, many journals are now requiring a description of their specific roles in the publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the relationships between credited contributions and author's rank has been limited to a few studies. Here we analyzed such a kind of data and show, quantitatively, that the regularity in the authorship contributions decreases with the number of authors in a paper. Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in papers follow three general patterns according to the nature of their contributions: (i) the total contribution increases with author's rank; (ii) the total contribution decreases with author's rank; and (iii) the total contribution is symmetric, with most of contributions being performed by first and last authors. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data retrieved from PLoS One and by devising a measurement of the effective number of authors in a paper. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the author ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the first and last authors being more likely to contribute more diversely in a scientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the intermediary positions of the rank contribute more in specific roles, such as collecting data. This indicates that the an unbiased evaluation of researchers must take into account the distinct types of scientific contributions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

As the higher education and science are the main source of knowledge adequate to contemporary terms then their integration should be investigated. Materials and methods: the material for this investigation was gathered as from individual experience in science and pedagogical activity of the author which were earlier published in hundreds of articles and fifteen monograph translated in eleven languages, as the materials of Moscow city seminar, the results of which were published in annual "Science of science investigations". This annual has been editing since 2004 and the author is the editor-in-chief of this edition. Also has been used other sources from different editions. The method of comparative analysis was used. Results: the author put forward the conception of inevitable integration of higher school and research institutions and forming a new structure - science-education consortium. Only such united structure can significantly rise both scientific researchers and higher education. And as a result, it will rise publishing activity and application of scientific researchers in real economy, social sphere, technological leadership. Discussion and conclusions: conception put forward in this article fragmentary has been published by author earlier and initiated discussion in scientific press, which was reflected in home RISC and abroad citation indexes.

	abstract = {For some, the science of science communication offers a hope for managing controversies in which the bulk of the scientific community perceives a clear set of facts but where other forces shape public policy. For others, understanding controversies is less instrumental but instead useful in explicating the ways in which science is embedded in society. Adapting the latter tradition to the science of science communication requires drawing insights from case studies that highlight historical and contextual factors but that may lack the predictive power sought by those who would manage controversy. Some recurring themes in the controversy literature include technical efficiency versus social equity, regulation versus freedom of choice, progress versus traditional values, and political priorities versus environmental sustainability. The challenge is creating a science of complex social contexts that is self- reflective about how it is shaped by the social and political forces it seeks to describe and, sometimes, manage. © Oxford University Press 2017.},

Scientific software is produced in a larger environment of collaboration that includes not only software developers, but also scientists who both use and extend the software for their research endeavors. The objective of this research is to understand the factors that promote and inhibit ecosystem formation and sustainment specific to scientific research software development. We have identified a set of relevant problems inhibiting sustainability in the scientific software context, including development, evolution and maintenance, as well as funding and leadership. We have collected data and used existing business, software, and innovation analysis techniques to examine the artifacts from several scientific research projects. We interviewed significant actors in select scientific ecosystems. We describe the differences between scientific software ecosystems and commercial software ecosystems, our initial results from interviews and data analysis, and we provide a set of recommendations and approaches towards handling software sustainability. Data suggests an ecosystem strategy can contribute to the survivability and sustainability of research software; however, such a strategy, which may distract from sustainability, requires thought and effort be given to establishing and nurturing the ecosystem, which in turn distract from the research mission. At this stage these initial results point us to future potentially fruitful investigations. © 2014 ACM.},

	abstract = {The science of science (SOS) is a rapidly developing field which aims to understand, quantify and predict scientific research and the resulting outcomes. The problem is essentially related to almost all scientific disciplines and thus has attracted attention of scholars from different backgrounds. Progress on SOS will lead to better solutions for many challenging issues, ranging from the selection of candidate faculty members by a university to the development of research fields to which a country should give priority. While different measurements have been designed to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars, journals and academic institutions, the multiplex structure, dynamics and evolution mechanisms of the whole system have been much less studied until recently. In this article, we review the recent advances in SOS, aiming to cover the topics from empirical study, network analysis, mechanistic models, ranking, prediction, and many important related issues. The results summarized in this review significantly deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and statistical rules governing the science system. Finally, we review the forefront of SOS research and point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this emerging interdisciplinary field. © 2017 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Although the "science of science communication" usually refers to the flow of scientific knowledge from scientists to the public, scientists direct most of their communications not to the public, but instead to other scientists in their field. This paper presents a case study on this understudied type of communication: within a discipline, among its practitioners. I argue thatmany of the contentious disagreements that exist today in the field in which I conduct my research - early science education - derive from a lack of operational definitions, such that when competing claims are made for the efficacy of one type of science instruction vs. another, the arguments are hopelessly disjointed. The aim of the paper is not to resolve the current claims and counterclaims about the most effective pedagogies in science education, but rather to note that the assessment of one approach vs. the other is all too often defended on the basis of strongly held beliefs, rather than on the results of replicable experiments, designed around operational definitions of the teaching methods being investigated. A detailed example of operational definitions from my own research on elementary school science instruction is provided. In addition, the paper addresses the issue of howcasual use of labels - both within the discipline and when communicating with the public- may in-advertently "undo" the benefits of operational definitions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The purpose of this research is to evaluate the co-authorship network of researchers of Kerman University of Medical Sciences. This assessment includes a look at the co-authorship, patterns of co-writing, researchers' outputs, authors ranking, map drawing of the co-authorship network, comparing the network of cowriting of the medical field with other domains, main component and key researchers, review The fit of the network of the co-writing of medical researchers with the small world theory, as well as person-centered indicators such as degree centrality, between centrality, closeness centrality Eigenvector, vector centrality, beta centrality, and interstitial centrality. Method: This research was carried out using scientific methods and network analysis techniques. The statistical population of this research is all articles of the faculty members and other researchers of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, indexed at the ISI database (the Science of Science Web site) during the period from 1978 to 2015, which consists of 1710 articles. The data were analyzed by Bibexcel, Histcite and Net drive softwares after pre-processing. Findings: The review of the articles showed that the pattern of four and five writers had the highest percentage of the co-written articles. The co-authorship network of this university is lower un an index such as the number of papers for each author from many other areas, and in the index of authors for each article is higher than most of the areas. The density index of this network is 0/003, its clustering coefficient is 0/64 and the percentage of the co-written articles in companion with the single-written articles is 97%. The researchers of this university have a high degree of collaboration in writing their articles, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Bahonar Kerman University and Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and the United States, Australia and England have the most scientific cooperation with Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Studies show that most of the articles published at Kerman University of Medical Sciences have been produced by a small number of researchers of this university, and the ratio of national-to-international collaboration at this university has been. 2/9. Conclusion: The co-authorship network of the researchers of this university is characterized by the average length trajectory and relatively high clustering coefficient, which is a small world network. The study of the distribution of the degree centrality of the central and key researchers of the network shows that the principle of "success breeds success", which was proposed by Age and Rousseau in 1996, is also valid in the surveyed network, and the researchers with high centrality play a very important role in the development and The evolution of co-writing networks. © 2018 University of Idaho Library.},

	abstract = {The cross-disciplinary Oxford Handbook on the Science of Science Communication contains 47 essays by 57 leading scholars organized into six sections: The first section establishes the need for a science of science communication, provides an overview of the area, examines sources of science knowledge and the ways in which changing media structures affect it, reveals what the public thinks about science, and situates current scientific controversies in their historical contexts. The book’s second part examines challenges to science including difficulties in peer review, rising numbers of retractions, publication and statistical biases, and hype. Successes and failures in communicating about four controversies are the subject of Part III: “mad cow,” nanotechnology, biotechnology, and the HPV and HBV vaccines. The fourth section focuses on the ways in which elite intermediaries communicate science. These include the national academies, scholarly presses, government organizations, museums, foundations, and social networks. It examines as well scientific deliberation among citizens and science-based policymaking. In Part V, the handbook treats science media interactions, knowledge-based journalism, polarized media environments, popular images of science, and the portrayal of science in entertainment, narratives, and comedy. The final section identifies the ways in which human biases that can affect communicated science can be overcome. Biases include resistant misinformation, inadequate frames, biases in moral reasoning, confirmation and selective exposure biases, innumeracy, recency effects, fear of the unnatural, normalization, false causal attribution, and public difficulty in processing uncertainty. Each section of the book includes a thematic synthesis. © Oxford University Press 2017.},

	abstract = {The professionals charged with delivering important food and nutrition science information to a public ever more hungry for science-based guidance have faced increasing challenges in an increasingly complex communications environment. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, in December 2016, issued a report assembling what has been published about science communication, both of emerging and contentious scientific issues such as vaccine and global climate science. The report outlines "Science of Science Communication" research gaps and urges a systems approach toward understanding the many factors that influence how both communicators and their intended audiences perceive and process science information. Although the Academies' report deals with a broad range of scientific issues, the authors here focus on communication of health and nutrition science, in the context of the report. Discussed are such influences on perception and understanding as preexisting individual and group psychological, economic, political, social, cultural, and media- or value-related mindsets. Noting the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, andMedicine report's repeated call for researchers towork more closely with communication practitioners, the authors of this article offer some insight into the effect that rapidly evolving social and other digital media may have on the various perceptual influences.

	abstract = {There is now compelling evidence that the statistical distributions of extensive individual bibliometric indicators collected by a scholar, such as the number of publications or the total number of citations, are well represented by a Log-Normal function when homogeneous samples are considered. A Log-Normal distribution function is the normal distribution for the logarithm of the variable. In linear scale it is a highly skewed distribution with a long tail in the high productivity side. We are still lacking a detailed and convincing ab-initio model able to explain observed Log-Normal distributions—this is the gap this paper sets out to fill. Here, we propose a general explanation of the observed evidence by developing a straightforward model based on the following simple assumptions: (1) the materialist principle of the natural equality of human intelligence, (2) the success breeds success effect, also known as Merton effect, which can be traced back to the Gospel parables about the Talents (Matthew) and Minas (Luke), and, (3) the recognition and reputation mechanism. Building on these assumptions we propose a distribution function that, although mathematically not identical to a Log-Normal distribution, shares with it all its main features. Our model well reproduces the empirical distributions, so the hypotheses at the basis of the model are not falsified. Therefore the distributions of the bibliometric parameters observed might be the result of chance and noise (chaos) related to multiplicative phenomena connected to a publish or perish inflationary mechanism, led by scholars’ recognition and reputations. In short, being a scholar in the right tail or in the left tail of the distribution could have very little connection to her/his merit and achievements. This interpretation might cast some doubts on the use of the number of papers and/or citations as a measure of scientific achievements. A tricky issue seems to emerge, that is: what then do bibliometric indicators really measure? This issue calls for deeper investigations into the meaning of bibliometric indicators. This is an interesting and intriguing topic for further research to be carried out within a wider interdisciplinary investigation of the science of science, which may include elements and investigation tools from philosophy, psychology and sociology. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Historically, science of science studies were/are performed by single investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data sets and analyses scales up, a "Big Science" approach (Price, 1963) is required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big science of science studies utilize "big data", i.e., large, complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned by different stakeholders. They apply a systems science approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed to support big science of science studies. The open access Scholarly Database (SDB) (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26 million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Science of Science (Sci2) tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth. The number of edges rather than nodes determined performance for network based algorithms. © AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Vienna 2013.},

	abstract = {Reputation is an important social construct in science, which enables informed quality assessments of both publications and careers of scientists in the absence of complete systemic information. However, the relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood, despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here, we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation rate Δc depends on the reputation of its central author i, in addition to its net citation count c. To estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly cited scientists, using the total citations Ci of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover cx, which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with c < cx, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in Ci. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for highly cited publications meaning that, for c ≥ cx, the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition, we have developed a stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science. © 2014, National Academy of Sciences.

However, we still have limited theoretical understanding of how individual heterogeneity relates to network heterogeneity. The model presented here provides a framework linking an individual's skill set to her position in the collaboration network, and the distribution of skills in the population to the structure of the collaboration network as a whole. This model suggests that there is a non-trivial relationship between skills and network position: individuals with a useful combination of skills will have a disproportionate number of links in the network. Indeed, in some cases, an individual's degree is non-monotonic in the number of skills she has - an individual with very few skills may outperform an individual with many. Special cases of the model suggest that the degree distribution of the network will be skewed, even when the distribution of skills is uniform in the population. The degree distribution becomes more skewed as problems become more difficult, leading to a community dominated by a few high-degree superstars. This has striking implications for labor market outcomes in industries where production is largely the result of collaborative effort. © Copyright 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {Evaluators face challenges such as program and intervention variability, time and budgetary constraints, and a complicated range of internal and external stakeholders. The design and implementation of evaluation for translational research (TR) is especially challenging since there is no universal agreement about what exactly 'translation' means. A range of effective methodologies for the evaluation of TR that have been used in the context of the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program include: process analysis, research publication analysis, cost analysis, surveys and interviews, qualitative methods, and experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Examples of each are described in this chapter. The methods used to evaluate TR constitute their own independent field of research, representing the formal study of how to encourage scientific research-to-practice or the 'science of science'. As such, the evaluation of TR and the broader field of medical research have a symbiotic relationship that will be of increasing importance as both evolve to meet future challenges and opportunities.

	abstract = {Historically, science of science (Sci2) studies have been performed by single investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data sets and analyses scales up, a “Big Science” approach (Price, Little science, big science, 1963) is required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big Sci2 studies utilize “big data”, i.e., large, complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned by different stakeholders. They apply a systems science approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed to support big Sci2 studies. The open access Scholarly Database (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26 million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Sci2 tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth. The number of edges rather than nodes determined performance for network based algorithms. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

However, only count-based information is involved as the input of ACA, which is not sufficiently informative for knowledge representations. This article catches several metadata in full text of citing papers but not aims at content-level information, which could increase the amount of information input to ACA but not increase computational complexity a lot. By involving information including the number of mentioned times in a citing paper, the number of context words in a citing sentence, and the published year of a reference, we propose a new method called MFTACA (metadata-in-full-text-based ACA). We combine these pieces of information into traditional ACA and compare the results between ACA and MFTACA by using factor analysis, network analysis, and MDS-measurement. The result of our empirical study indicates that compared with traditional ACA, our proposed method shows a better clustering performance in visualizations and reveals more details in displaying intellectual structures.},

	abstract = {Human creativity is the ultimate driving force behind scientific progress. While the building blocks of innovations are often embodied in existing knowledge, it is creativity that blends seemingly disparate ideas. Existing studies have made striding advances in quantifying creativity of scientific publications by investigating their citation relationships. Yet, little is known hitherto about the underlying mechanisms governing scientific creative processes, largely due to that a paper's references, at best, only partially reflect its authors' actual information consumption. This work represents an initial step towards fine-grained understanding of creative processes in scientific enterprise. In specific, using two web-scale longitudinal datasets (120.1 million papers and 53.5 billion web requests spanning 4 years), we directly contrast authors' information consumption behaviors against their knowledge products. We find that, of 59.0% papers across all scientific fields, 25.7% of their creativity can be readily explained by information consumed by their authors. Further, by leveraging these findings, we develop a predictive framework that accurately identifies the most critical knowledge to fostering target scientific innovations. We believe that our framework is of fundamental importance to the study of scientific creativity. It promotes strategies to stimulate and potentially automate creative processes, and provides insights towards more effective designs of information recommendation platforms. © 2016 ACM.},

The objective of current study is to analyze and visualize the trend of global scientific activities in the field of breast cancer during a period of 10 years through 2006-2015. Methods: The current study was performed by utilizing the scientometrics analysis and mapping the co-authorship and co-organization networks. The Web of Science Core Collection (WoS-CC) database was used to extract all papers indexed as a topic of breast cancer through 2006 to 2015. Research productivity was measured through analysis several parameters, including: the number and time course of publications, the journal and language of publications, the frequency and type of publications, as well as top 20 active sub-categories together with country contribution. The extracted data were transferred into the Excel charts and plotted as diagrams. The Science of Science (Sci2) and CiteSpace softwares were used as tools for mapping the co-authorship and coorganization networks of the published papers. Results: Analysis of data indicated that the number of publications in the field of breast cancer has linearly increased and correlated with the time-course of the study. The number of publication indexed in WoS-CC in 2015 was two times greater than that of 2006, which reached from 15 229 documents in 2006 to 30 667 documents in 2015. English Language accounted for 98% of total publications as the most dominant language. The vast majority of publications' type was in the form of original journal articles (64.7%). Based on Bradford scatterings law, the journal of "Cancer Research" was the most productive journal among the core journals, while the USA, China, and England were the most prolific countries in the field. The co-organization network indicated the dominant role of Harvard University in the field. Conclusion: The integrity of network indicated that scientists in the field of breast cancer working collaboratively to tackle the number one threat in women health. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Situated within science of science, this study analyzes the nature, practice, and impact of ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability as a form of science and technology (S&T) within the defining context of smart sustainable cities. Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

This trend promotes the use of objective data by decision-makers in the fields of innovation policy and technology management. These decision-makers seek more reliable research and development at an earlier stage to contribute to the national economy. Under this worldwide trend, there is a high demand for quantitative analysis accompanying complex IT skills from governmental officers and non-IT researchers. The purpose of this research is to extract the destinations of currently growing fields of science by means of tracking citations and to capture signs of state of the art studies. The analysis data are bibliographic data of academic papers retrieved from Web of Science. I provide results for 16 growing topics as of July 2016. I deepen the understanding of the “convolutional neural network” among a lot of topics, and found future application candidates. I provide a methodology to discover future seeds of research and development. Additionally, the analysis system used in this research automatically publishes its results, and always provides the results.

Scientists' combined choices affect the direction and efficiency of scientific discovery as awhole. In this paper, we infer preferences that shape problem selection from patterns of published findings and then quantify their efficiency. We represent research problems as links between scientific entities in a knowledge network. We then build a generative model of discovery informed by qualitative research on scientific problem selection. We map salient features from this literature to key network properties: an entity's importance corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem's difficulty corresponds to the network distance it spans. Drawing on millions of papers and patents published over 30 years, we use this model to infer the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative research choices focused on building up knowledge around important molecules. These choices become more conservative over time. The observed strategy is efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for science as a whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more efficient at exploring mature knowledge networks. We find that increased risk-taking and the publication of experimental failures would substantially improve the speed of discovery. We consider institutional shifts in grant making, evaluation, and publication that would help realize these efficiencies.},

	abstract = {Analyzing a large data set of publications drawn from the most competitive journals in the natural and social sciences we show that research careers exhibit the broad distributions of individual achievement characteristic of systems in which cumulative advantage plays a key role. While most researchers are personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process, little is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual researchers. Here we analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set of researchers publishing in high-impact journals, accounting for censoring biases in the publication data by using distinct researcher cohorts defined over non-overlapping time periods. For each researcher cohort we calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values around 0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For perspective, these observed values are well in excess of the inequality levels observed for personal income in developing countries. Investigating possible sources of this inequality, we identify two potential mechanisms that act at the level of the individual that may play defining roles in the emergence of the broad productivity and impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the average time interval between a researcher’s successive publications in top journals decreases with each subsequent publication. Second, after controlling for the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare the citation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher’s publication record. We find that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there is more likely to be a decreasing trend in the relative citation impact with each subsequent publication. This pattern highlights the difficulty of repeatedly producing research findings in the highest citation-impact echelon, as well as the role played by finite career and knowledge life-cycles, and the intriguing possibility that confirmation bias plays a role in the evaluation of scientific careers. © 2014 Petersen and Penner; licensee Springer.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an Ontology-Based Data Management (OBDM) approach to coordinate, integrate and maintain the data needed for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy development. The OBDM approach is a form of integration of information in which the global schema of data is substituted by the conceptual model of the domain, formally specified through an ontology. Implemented in Sapientia, the ontology of multi-dimensional research assessment, it offers a transparent platform as the base for the assessment process; it enables one to define and specify in an unambiguous way the indicators on which the evaluation is based, and to track their evolution over time; also it allows to the analysis of the effects of the actual use of the indicators on the behavior of scholars, and spot opportunistic behaviors; and it provides a monitoring system to track over time the changes in the established evaluation criteria and their consequences for the research system. It is argued that easier access to and a more transparent view of scientific-scholarly outcomes help to improve the understanding of basic science and the communication of research outcomes to the wider public. An OBDM approach could successfully contribute to solve some of the key issues in the integration of heterogeneous data for STI policies. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Background: Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) is a landmark imaging and omics study in AD. ADNI research literature has increased substantially over the past decade, which poses challenges for effectively communicating information about the results and impact of ADNI-related studies. In this work, we employed advanced information visualization techniques to perform a comprehensive and systematic mapping of the ADNI scientific growth and impact over a period of 12 years. Methods: Citation information of ADNI-related publications from 01/01/2003 to 05/12/2015 were downloaded from the Scopus database. Five fields, including authors, years, affiliations, sources (journals), and keywords, were extracted and preprocessed. Statistical analyses were performed on basic publication data as well as journal and citations information. Science mapping workflows were conducted using the Science of Science (Sci2) Tool to generate geospatial, topical, and collaboration visualizations at the micro (individual) to macro (global) levels such as geospatial layouts of institutional collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence networks, and author collaboration networks evolving over time. Results: During the studied period, 996 ADNI manuscripts were published across 233 journals and conference proceedings. The number of publications grew linearly from 2008 to 2015, so did the number of involved institutions. ADNI publications received much more citations than typical papers from the same set of journals. Collaborations were visualized at multiple levels, including authors, institutions, and research areas. The evolution of key ADNI research topics was also plotted over the studied period. Conclusions: Both statistical and visualization results demonstrate the increasing attention of ADNI research, strong citation impact of ADNI publications, the expanding collaboration networks among researchers, institutions and ADNI core areas, and the dynamic evolution of ADNI research topics. The visualizations presented here can help improve daily decision making based on a deep understanding of existing patterns and trends using proven and replicable data analysis and visualization methods. They have great potential to provide new insights and actionable knowledge for helping translational research in AD. © 2017 Yao et al.

Our algorithm relies only upon the author and citation graphs available for the whole period covered by the WoS. A pair-wise publication similarity metric, which is based on common co-authors, self-citations, shared references and citations, is established to perform a two-step agglomerative clustering that first connects individual papers and then merges similar clusters. This parameterized model is optimized using an h-index based recall measure, favoring the correct assignment of well-cited publications, and a name-initials-based precision using WoS metadata and cross-referenced Google Scholar profiles. Despite the use of limited metadata, we reach a recall of 87% and a precision of 88% with a preference for researchers with high h-index values. 47 million articles of WoS can be disambiguated on a single machine in less than a day. We develop an h-index distribution model, confirming that the prediction is in excellent agreement with the empirical data, and yielding insight into the utility of the h-index in real academic ranking scenarios. © 2014 Schulz et al.},

We assess first the speed and range of diffusion of CDM and investigate next the ‘origins’ and further ‘genealogical’ make up of the knowledge recombinations within the CDM universe. We find that CDM is cited by a growing number of papers, which spread over a variety of fields, and that it compares very well with the most cited comparable articles in indexed journals in its domain of research. We further find that the CDM universe is mainly constituted of three large clusters and for each of them we are able to identify knowledge paths going from the CDM and earlier cited papers to the subsequent main citing papers.

	abstract = {Delimitation of scientific subfields constitutes one of the key problems in scientometrics. De Bruin and Moed (1993) suggested that "corporate address words" or word co-occurrence in affiliation field could be used. In science, researchers construct knowledge through neologisms. Studies of new scientific concepts indicated us new trends on naming institutions with neologisms. Therefore, one can postulate that neologisms are markers of emerging scientific field, and naming institution after neologisms could be part of a legitimation process. The aim of this paper is to explore this hypothesis through the bibliometric analysis of one case study related to the diffusion process of the concept of "interventional radiology" (IR). The study of the history of IR concept and its trends using affiliation addresses allows us to better understand how IR field has attempted to institutionalize and to gain its autonomy. Several institutions publishing in the field of IR have undertaken a legitimization process by entitling department "interventional radiology", but the specialty has partially or internationally failed to gain its scientific autonomy. In conclusion, measuring the trend of newly named institutions after a neologism can be used to assess the degree of institutionalization for a new medical or scientific field.},

	abstract = {To paraphrase Marx, sociologists have only interpreted science; the point is to improve it. The Rational and the Social attempts both. It begins by sketching recent sociological approaches to science, notably the strong programme – Bloor’s ‘science of science’ and Barnes’s ‘finitism’ – and that of the ‘anthropologists in the lab’, Collins and Latour and Woolgar. The author argues that although sociological accounts are valuable in many respects, when morals are drawn about the structure and epistemology of science, they are badly flawed. In rejecting the sociological theory of science, it is not necessary to conclude that science develops without reference to the social. James Robert Brown argues for an alternative account. He proposes a novel way of viewing the history of science as a source of evidence for how to do good science and argues that the most important aspect of methodology is that it is comparative. Rival theories are evaluated by comparison and the contribution of the social to this process is inevitable and should be acknowledged. This is the challenge to science. © 1989 James Robert Brown.

	abstract = {Background: Cyclodextrins (CDs), as one type of the novel pharmaceutical excipients, have been widely used in drug delivery and pharmaceutical industry. Over the past decades, a large amount of molecular modeling studies in CDs were reported for profound understanding of structural, dynamic and energetic features of CDs systems. Thus, this review is focused on qualitative and quantitative analysis of research outputs on molecular modeling in CDs. Methods: The original data were collected from Web of Science and analyzed by scientific knowledge mapping tools, including Citespace, Science of Science, VOSviewer, GPSvisualizer and Gephi software. Scientific knowledge mapping, as an emerging approach for literature analysis, was employed to identify the knowledge structure and capture the development of the science in a visual way. Results: The results of analysis included research outputs landscape, collaboration patterns, knowledge structure and research frontiers shift with time. China had the largest contributions to the publication number in this area, while USA dominated the high quality research outputs. International collaboration between USA and Europe was much stronger than that within Asia. J American Chemical Society, as one of the most important journals, played a pivotal role in linking different research fields. Furthermore, seven important thematic clusters were identified by the research cluster analysis with visualization tools and demonstrated from three different perspectives including: (1) the mostly-used CD molecules: β-Cyclodextrin, (2) preferred modeling tools: docking calcula-tion and molecular dynamic, (3) hot research fields: structural properties, solubility, chiral recognition and solid-state inclusion complexes. Moreover, research frontier shift in the past three decades was traced by detecting keywords bursts with high citation. Conclusion: The current review provided us a macro-perspective and intellectual landscape to molecular modeling in CDs. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {A central question in science of science concerns how time affects citations. Despite the long-standing interests and its broad impact, we lack systematic answers to this simple yet fundamental question. By reviewing and classifying prior studies for the past 50 years, we find a significant lack of consensus in the literature, primarily due to the coexistence of retrospective and prospective approaches to measuring citation age distributions. These two approaches have been pursued in parallel, lacking any known connections between the two. Here we developed a new theoretical framework that not only allows us to connect the two approaches through precise mathematical relationships, it also helps us reconcile the interplay between temporal decay of citations and the growth of science, helping us uncover new functional forms characterizing citation age distributions. We find retrospective distribution follows a lognormal distribution with exponential cutoff, while prospective distribution is governed by the interplay between a lognormal distribution and the growth in the number of references. Most interestingly, the two approaches can be connected once rescaled by the growth of publications and citations. We further validate our framework using both large-scale citation datasets and analytical models capturing citation dynamics. Together this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the time dimension of science, representing a new empirical and theoretical basis for all future studies in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the concept of tension, Pierre Bourdieu gives the key tool to distinguish between the field of science and the field in which we fight for the legitimacy of science (within the world of science). Likewise, his concept of pressure is key in order to understand the relationship between society and science, the struggle for the legitimacy of science in the social world (three authors have developed such topics: Gaston Bachelard, the first, of epistemological order; Bourdieu himself, the second, of sociological order; And Jean-Francois Lyotard, the third, of a political order). However, Bourdieu oscillates between differentiating and mixing, both the tensions of each of the fields mentioned, as the opposition between tension and pressure. On the other hand, Bour-dieu allows us to think of some of the effects of the pressure exerted on science by funding bodies, industries, the State and the public: Scientometrics, leaving an 'alodoxia'; the associations and institutions, that leave a lack of research that seeks to know; and a dissemination of information that leaves a decontextualization and a reproduction of the dominant system. We use in detail, among other resources, the concept of field, postulated by Pierre Bourdieu, and we read his text Science of Science and Reflexivity [2000-1].},

	abstract = {Progress in science has advanced the development of human society across history with dramatic revolutions shaped by information theory genetic cloning, and artificial intelligence, among the many scientific achievements produced in the 20 century. However, the way that science advances itself is much less well-understood. In this work, we study the evolution of scientific development over the past century by presenting an anatomy of 89 million digitalized papers published between 1900 and 2015. We find that science has benefited from the shift from individual work to collaborative effort, with over 90% of the world-leading innovations generated by collaborations in this century, nearly four times higher than they were in the 1900s. We discover that rather than the frequent myopic-and self-referencing that was common in the early 20 century, modern scientists instead tend to look for literature further back and farther around. Finally, we also observe the globalization of scientific development from 1900 to 2015, including 25-fold and 7-fold increases in international collaborations and citations, respectively, as well as a dramatic decline in the dominant accumulation of citations by the US, the UK, and Germany, from ∼95% to ∼50% over the same period. Our discoveries are meant to serve as a starter for exploring the visionary ways in which science has developed throughout the past century, generating insight into and an impact upon the current scientific innovations and funding policies. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

This paper introduces a definition of big metadata in the context of scientific data repositories and discusses the challenges in big metadata analytics due to the messiness, lack of structures suitable for analytics and heterogeneity in such big metadata. A methodological framework is proposed, which contains conceptual and computational workflows intercepting through collaborative documentation. The workflow-based methodological framework promotes transparency and contributes to research reproducibility. The paper also describes the experience and lessons learned from a four-year big metadata project involving all aspects of the workflow-based methodologies. The methodological framework presented in this paper is a timely contribution to the field of scientometrics and the science of science and policy as the potential value of big metadata is drawing more attention from research and policy maker communities.

	abstract = {This article examines the science-of-science-communication measurement problem. In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The "beliefs" individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The article shows how appropriately designed "science comprehension" tests-one general and one specific to climate change-can be used to measure individuals' reasoning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time. © 2015 International Society of Political Psychology.},

	abstract = {Institutions are the ‘rules of the game’ that give structure and meaning to social life. Institutional innovation is a long and complex social process, and is much less well understood than technological innovation. In this chapter, we explore how an engineering approach to the process of institutional innovation might influence the trajectory or rate of innovation, specifically in pre-paradigmatic settings where there are rival schools of thought. Our motivating case is cyber security, especially the effort to quantify security and risk. The process of institutional innovation is framed in Boisot’s theory of the social learning cycle, and the role of knowledge artefacts during the cycle. A computational model is presented using agent-based modelling (ABM) to examine how the knowledge artefacts of different characteristics affect innovation rate and learning. Experimental results show that the likelihood of the quant school winning is critically dependent on the learning rate (i.e., the rate of improvement in how well its knowledge artefacts fit nature and are therefore effective in facilitating innovation success). © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Surveying studies of cultural cognition and related dynamics, it demonstrates how the form of disciplined observation, measurement, and inference distinctive of scientific inquiry can be used to test rival hypotheses on the nature of persistent public conflict over societal risks; indeed, it argues that satisfactory insight into this phenomenon can be achieved only by these means, as opposed to the ad hoc story-telling dominant in popular and even some forms of scholarly discourse. Synthesizing the evidence, the essay proposes that conflict over what is known by science arises from the very conditions of individual freedom and cultural pluralism that make liberal democratic societies distinctively congenial to science. This tension, however, is not an "inherent contradiction"; it is a problem to be solved - by the science of science communication understood as a "new political science" for perfecting enlightened self-government.},

Most papers do not explicitly identify "science communication" as the object of study. Most of the relevant work is focused on audience research, indicating the potential for using the results for evidence-based science communication practice.

	abstract = {The paper explores possible influences that some developments in the field of branches of AI, called automated discovery and machine learning systems, might have upon some aspects of the old debate between Francis Bacon’s inductivism and Karl Popper’s falsificationism. Donald Gillies facetiously calls this controversy ‘the duel of two English knights’, and claims, after some analysis of historical cases of discovery, that Baconian induction had been used in science very rarely, or not at all, although he argues that the situation has changed with the advent of machine learning systems. (Some clarification of terms machine learning and automated discovery is required here. The key idea of machine learning is that, given data with associated outcomes, software can be trained to make those associations in future cases which typically amounts to inducing some rules from individual cases classified by the experts. Automated discovery (also called machine discovery) deals with uncovering new knowledge that is valuable for human beings, and its key idea is that discovery is like other intellectual tasks and that the general idea of heuristic search in problem spaces applies also to discovery tasks. However, since machine learning systems discover (very low-level) regularities in data, throughout this paper I use the generic term automated discovery for both kinds of systems. I will elaborate on this later on). Gillies’s line of argument can be generalised: thanks to automated discovery systems, philosophers of science have at their disposal a new tool for empirically testing their philosophical hypotheses. Accordingly, in the paper, I will address the question, which of the two philosophical conceptions of scientific method is better vindicated in view of the successes and failures of systems developed within three major research programmes in the field: machine learning systems in the Turing tradition, normative theory of scientific discovery formulated by Herbert Simon’s group and the programme called HHNT, proposed by J. Holland, K. Holyoak, R. Nisbett and P. Thagard. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In order to understand what is meant by roadmaps - and not to confuse roadmaps with foresight in general - a comparative analysis was jointly performed by the Beijing Research Centre for Science of Science (BRCSS) under the Beijing Academy of Science and Technology and the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI). This joint project investigated several cases according to a set of criteria and compared the content. The aim of the project was mutual learning and the results revealed that the differences can be found on different levels like the understanding of the terminology (not only language), cultural understandings, the background of the innovation system and contexts of the roadmaps and the understanding of the objectives. The way the process is performed differed significantly whereas the differences in the processes themselves, the number of participants or the topic fields were rather similar. In the paper, some of the differences are discussed in context and lessons learned are explained. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

It is therefore important for the future of scientific practice to reflect upon the individual scientist’s ethical responsibilities within teams. To facilitate this reflection we show labor force trends in the US revealing a skewed growth in academic ranks and increased levels of competition for promotion within the system; we analyze teaming trends across disciplines and national borders demonstrating why it is becoming difficult to distribute credit and to avoid conflicts of interest; and we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to show how science is outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of particular concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the mentor–mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue ethics across scientific generations. These trends and emerging organizational complexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms that transcend team heterogeneity and hierarchy. To this end, our expository analysis provides a survey of ethical issues in team settings to inform science ethics education and science policy. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This study will examine the changes in research in Danish economics, and investigate to what extent these changes can be explained by external factors in the research culture. The study finds that articles with empirical research, quantitative research and/or survey have a slightly higher average number of authors than theoretical, interview, data and qualitative research. However, the average number of authors increases for articles with all types of research and research approaches, and it seems like something more than external factors are affecting researchers' collaboration behavior.},

Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that "big science" leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects of 'science of science.'. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {"Japanese Philosophy" in the World Since philosophers have often spoken of Greek philosophy, French philosophy, English philosophy, American philosophy, and so on, it would seem plausible to speak of "Japanese philosophy." Nevertheless, until about twenty or thirty years ago, philosophers in Japan generally did not take this to be a philosophically meaningful locution. It was from the beginning regarded as out of the question. If one did speak expressly of "Japanese philosophy," this tended to be understood as stressing the "Japanese" character of the philosophy in question, and this was deemed inappropriate to the scholarly nature of philosophy as an objective and universal discipline. The universality of philosophy was implicitly understood to mean the scholarly nature of Western philosophy. When one spoke of "philosophy" in Japanese academia, this was understood to obviously imply "Western philosophy," and if one studied philosophy at a Japanese university, one studied as a matter of course-and often exclusively-Western philosophers from Plato and Aristotle, through Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, to Husserl and Levinas. Of course, one might focus on a particular topic in order to clarify the relations between these different figures or to trace the history of a certain problematic; or one might go a step further and develop one's own philosophical path of thinking through one's study of these Western philosophers. But it remained the case that philosophy in modern Japan was an imported academic discipline of Western origin. The above state of affairs is historically explicable insofar as in premodern times there was, as Nakae Chomin famously quipped, "no philosophy in Japan"-assuming, that is, that we strictly adhere to the Western concept of "philosophy." While this state of affairs had its historical conditions, the situation is beginning to change as we enter into a new era in which we can say-as Nishida Kitaro foresaw in the midst of the world-historical developments of his time-"the world is today becoming real." In the wake of a shift away from the past identification of Western philosophy with philosophy as such, and in a movement toward opening up a discourse of "world philosophy," new and important contributions to philosophy can be expected to come from ideas that originate in non-Western traditions of culture and thought. One reason for this is that the European philosophical tradition, the tradition that Japanese philosophers have long held up as a model, has entered an era of radical self-questioning. In particular, certain dominant ways of thinking in modern European philosophy, certain foundational ideas that were previously held to be certain and even self-evident, have fallen into question. The ontological notion of substance, the logical principle of identity, subject/object dualism in epistemology, the strict division between reason and sensibility, and underlying everything the idea of "God" or the distinctively modern idea of the absolute "subject"-all of these at once dominant and fundamental ways of thinking, have fallen into question. We can look upon "deconstruction" as one palpable manifestation of this state of affairs. The turn away from the previous identification of European philosophy with philosophy as such, and the development of world philosophy, will no doubt advance a philosophical thinking that is no longer restricted to the specific "love of wisdom" and "science of principles as the science of sciences" that originated in the West. Contact between different traditions promises to help shed light on shared fundamental structures of human existence, and it will encourage new ways of bringing to awareness the understandings of the world and the self found in our various manners of being-in-the-world. What is being heralded as "the end of philosophy" concerns the system of knowledge that places metaphysics in the position of first philosophy. "World philosophy" calls for a transformation of philosophy itself along with a transformation of the world. For Western philosophy as well, an "other beginning" of thinking is called for; and the possibility of discovering indications for such an other beginning in the insights of traditions outside of Europe is now being realized.1 Now, in order for Japanese philosophy to be capable of making a meaningful contribution to world philosophy, Japanese philosophers need to go beyond their specialized research in European philosophy in order to discover, by way of a dialogical confrontation, what Nishida called a "deeper ba in the newly shared world-horizon that opens up on this deeper basis. Two examples which met the above conditions, and which were articulated so as to be comprehensible to Westerners, are Suzuki Daisetsu's (Daisetz Suzuki) "Eastern Way of Seeing" and Izutsu Toshihiko's "Eastern Philosophy." It is the content of their works, and not just the fact that many of them were written in English, which made them significant initial formulations of what Japanese thinkers can contribute to world philosophy. While both concerned themselves with "Eastern" ideas, these ideas were reinterpreted within a worldhorizon and were creatively transformed to address the world. Beyond these contributions, on a properly philosophical level stands the thought of Nishida Kitaro, who took up the theme of the "world." And after Nishida, in the wake of changes in the spiritual climate of the world, the philosophy of Nishitani Keiji assumes special significance. Just as European philosophy as such should not be inflated into world philosophy, non-European traditions as they are cannot contribute directly to world philosophy. While European philosophy must be deconstructed and perhaps even pass through what Heidegger calls the end of philosophy to an other beginning from which it can undergo a transformative turn to world philosophy, the insights harbored in Eastern traditions need to be transformed into "philosophical principles" before they can contribute to world philosophy. Nishida's key ideas, such as "pure experience," "place," and "contradictory self-identity," can be viewed as traditional insights transformed into philosophical principles. Nishitani took Mahayana Buddhism's key term "emptiness" and refashioned it into a fundamental philosophical category. The potential for Japanese philosophy to contribute to the development of world philosophy is based in at least the following two aspects of its historical foundations. First of all, the "place" of Japan-which is constituted in the understanding of self and world by means of the Japanese language-is not simply that of Japan alone, since the Japanese tradition harbors the influence of a number of traditions, including those of India, central Asia, China, and Korea. Shaped by these cross-fertilizations, the "place" of Japan developed as one great confluence of the rich sediments of these non-Western traditions, one that can undoubtedly serve as a significant reservoir of ideas for the formation of world philosophy. Secondly, this "place" of Japan now contains within it the experience, accumulated over the course of a century and a half, of a monumental encounter, collision, and exchange with Western culture and its products. Traversingthe two stages of the "opening of the country" (kaikoku) in the Meiji period and the country's defeat in World War II, and despite the fact that Japanese society on the whole-albeit with some exceptions-was characterized by a turning of its back on tradition (this too is a phenomenon of cross-cultural encounter), there were exceptional individuals who placed themselves in the gap between these radically different traditions and took up the challenge of rethinking the fundamental principles of the world from this vantage point. We inherit the fruits of the efforts of these great thinkers who subjected their very existence to their cross-cultural experiments. Examples include Natsume Soseki in literature, Nishida Kitaro in philosophy, and Suzuki Daisetsu in religion. Such intercultural experience in the "place" of Japan may well come to be seen as one paradigm for the interculturality and multiculturalism that is becoming such a prevalent concern in the world today. Japanese philosophy unfolds in the world and for the world, and Japanese philosophers are called on to show the world what and how they think. A positive contribution to world philosophy can be made by Japanese philosophers only if they engage in genuine self-criticism, that is to say, in self-criticism made real by taking into account criticism from the world. The present anthology, Japanese and Continental Philosophy: Conversations with the Kyoto School, which includes critical interpretations of and dialogues with the Kyoto School by European and North American scholars, is certainly a timely and significant venture. Confronted with Western philosophy, Nishida realized that the Eastern tradition was lacking in "logic," and so he took as his life's task the formulation of such a logic. Japanese philosophy became in this situation a topos of thought which lets Japan be reflected in the world and lets the world be reflected in Japan. What is needed today is a world brought together by the fruits of mutual critique and mutual supplementation between different traditions. In order to discuss more specifically the kind of contributions that can be made by Japanese philosophy, let us look more closely at the philosophy of the Kyoto School. © 2011 by Indiana University Press.

Bernal's Social Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay dormant until after World War II, when DJD Price's books Science Since Babylon in and Little Science, Big Science in were published in1961 and 1963. His role as the "father of scientometrics" is clearly evident by using the HistCite software to visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal Scientometrics on the growth of the field. Scientometrics owes its name to V. V. Nalimov, the author of Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who adapted the neologism for the journal. The primordial paper on citation indexing by Garfield which appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge between Bernal and Price. The timeline for the evolution of scientometrics is demonstrated by a HistCite tabulation of the ranked citation index of all the 100,000 references cited in the 3,000 papers citing Price.},

	abstract = {The author of the present article proves the veracity of the postulate, which was formulated by Bogdan Suchodolski and concerned the necessity of popularizing the history of science. The stipulation is still greatly important for many fields of human activity. Bogdan Suchodolski was not the first and the only thinker, who revealed the unquestionable significance of disseminating the history of science as scientific branch: For the first time the problem was noticed in 1900 during International Congress of Comparative History in Paris and in 1903 during International Congress of Historical Sciences in Rome, when the idea of universalizing the history of science was put forward, among others, by: Paul Tannery, Carre de Vaux, Gino Ioria and Karl Sudhoff. All the mentioned participants declared then the necessity of teaching the history of science both in the secondary schools and in the universities. In the article was also included a detailed description of conceptions formulated by Paul Tannery and Michel Lhéritier in the inter-war period that concerned popularizing the history of science, and differed much from each other. Unlike Paul Tannery, Michel Lhéritier advised against separating history of science from the whole of history. On the occasion of describing the inter-war period the author is paying a special attention to the role, which was played by International Conference of Teaching History in Hague in 1932. In that time a representative of International Committee on the History of Sciences and International Academy of the History of Sciences--Aldo Mieli--presented the idea of disseminating the history of science, which resulted in a resolution saying that the discussed branch should be taught in the primary and secondary schools, and in the universities as well. Further, the paper includes the description of the detailed conceptions that were put forward after World War II by the members of Committee on Teaching within International Academy of the History of Science and the participants of International Congress of the History of Science in 1965 and in 1968, and concerned the idea of introducing compulsory lectures on the history of science for prospective teachers and lecturers, and the ways of universalizing the discussed branch. The author is also presenting American conceptions of popularizing the history of science that were created by George Sarton, Derek J. de Solla Price and by Committee on University Education that was established in the 1970s. In the article one can find a specific reflection of Bogdan Suchodolski on popularizing the history of science through admitting its social role, making it the main element of educating 'the modern man' and teaching the branch in Poland. The author describes the above-mentioned stipulations in detail. At the same time, the last part of the paper reveals Polish thought in the field of disseminating the history of science in the inter-war period, so in times, when Bogdan Suchodolski was on the point of building his own idea. The author makes an attempt at showing to what extent Bogdan Suchodolski was inspired by one of the most famous Polish originators and precursors of a new branch 'science of science'--Florian Znaniecki. On this occasion the author draws definite conclusions concerning similarities and differences between the conception created by Bogdan Suchodolski, and the ideas that were put forward by his predecessor.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the increasingly widespread view that Bourdieu's sociological analysis is flawed by excessive determinism and thus is anti-rationalist in its socio-political implications. Against this contention, it argues that works such as Distinction should be viewed as critiques of an absolutist universalism rather than of universalism as such. Moreover, Bourdieu's logic of practice, it is claimed, caters not only for a degree of autonomy at the level of the individual, but also identifies two key intellectual fields as pivotal cultural accumulators of autonomous or critical thought: the artistic field and the scientific field. In this context, it is particularly important that one of his very late works, Science of Science and Reflexivity, gives such a vital role to the free ‘corporation’ of scientists as judges of scientific reputations. His concept of artistic autonomy is further explored by illustrations from casestudies in historical sociology, by writers who have been decisively influenced by his sociology of literature. The article ends with an application of his ideas to contemporary newspaper obituaries of cultural producers. This illuminates in particular an underlying issue in his sociology: current dangers to artistic autonomy. © 2006, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

He was present in Polish science owing to his publication - also specially prepared for Polish journals - and for his participation in Polish-Soviet science of science conferences organized alternately in Poland and in (of that time) Soviet Union. He had a high opinion - which he many times expressed - on contemporary condition of Polish science of science as well as on its previous achievements. In such opinion he was not isolated; also John Bernal and Derek de Solla Price referred in their papers to precursory statements of Maria and Stanislaw Ossowski formulating already in the thirties of XX century progressive programme for science of science research. Ten years earlier a similar views upon science presented world-famous Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki. So, in the first part of the paper a common way of thinking and approaching science of science basic problems in Ossowski's, Znaniecki's and Nalimov's works is presented. In the second part the direct contacts of Nalimov with Polish science of science researchers widely described and commentated in Polish journals are discussed. At least using citation analysis the influence of Nalimov's ideas on science of science and scientometrics in Poland is presented.

	abstract = {Introduction Johann Gottlieb Fichte developed a system of philosophy known in German as the Wissenschaftslehre. The proper translation of this technical term has always been disputed, but Fichte scholars have usually settled on “Science of Knowledge”, “Doctrine of Science”, or “Theory of Scientific Knowledge”. None of these translations has ever been very informative, and they are even less helpful now that modern English tends to associate that which is scientific with the natural sciences and, to a lesser degree, the social sciences. Given the burden that the German term must bear, contemporary scholars routinely leave it untranslated in their discussions of Fichte's thought. Therefore, throughout this chapter Fichte's system will simply be called the Wissenschaftslehre. German philosophers in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries had a more expansive concept of science than we have today. Consequently, although the Wissenschaftslehre is not a science in our sense of the term, Fichte felt no discomfort in regarding his system as a scientific one. In so far as he considers the Wissenschaftslehre a science, Fichte argues not only that (i) it possesses a systematic form, but also that (ii) it possesses a systematic form in virtue of its being derived from a single first principle that is known with certainty. Moreover, he argues that (iii) the Wissenschaftslehre is the foundational discipline that grounds all theoretical and practical knowledge and demonstrates their fundamental unity; therefore, he sometimes refers to the Wissenschaftslehre as “the science of science”. Fichte's Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge attempts to demonstrate these three aspects of the Wissenschaftslehre. © Editorial matter and selection, 2005 John Shand.},

Of particular importance is the distinction between folk knowledge and abstract theoretical knowledge leading to a distinction between folk science and folk religion on the one hand and the reflective, theoretical, abstract form of thought that characterizes both advanced scientific thought and sophisticated theological reasoning on the other. Both folk science and folk religion emerge from commonsense reasoning about the world, a form of reasoning bequeathed to us by the processes of natural selection. Suggestions are made about what scientists and theologians can do if they accept these claims. © 2005 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon.},

	abstract = {When the journal Minerva was founded in 1962, science and higher educational issues were high on the agenda, lending impetus to the interdisciplinary field of "Science Studies" qua "Science Policy Studies." As government expenditures for promoting various branches of science increased dramatically on both sides of the East-West Cold War divide, some common issues regarding research management also emerged and with it an interest in closer academic interaction in the areas of history and policy of science. Through a close reading of many early issues of Minerva but also of its later competitor journal Science Studies (now called Social Studies of Science) the paper traces the initial optimism of an academically based Science Studies dialogue across the Cold War divide and the creation in 1971 of the International Commission for Science Policy Studies as a bridging forum, one that Minerva strangely chose to ignore. In this light, attention is drawn to aspects of the often forgotten history of Science Studies in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European block. Reviewed also are several early discussions that are still relevant today: e. g., regarding differing concepts of Big Science, science and democracy, autonomy in higher education and what conditions are necessary to sustain academic freedom and scientific integrity (some of Edward Shils' primary concerns). Finally, it is noted how the question of quantitative methods to measure scientific productivity lay at the heart of a "Science of Science" movement of the 1960s has re-emerged in a new form integral to the notion of a "Science of Science Policy." © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

While earning my doctorate in microbiology, I found myself more interested in my political activities than my experiments. Thus, my science policy career aspirations were born from merging my love of science with my interest in policy and politics. After receiving my doctorate, I accepted the Henry Luce Scholarship, which allowed me to live in South Korea for 1 year and delve into the field of science policy research. This introduction into science policy occurred at the South Korean think tank called the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI†). During that year, I used textbooks, colleagues, and hands-on research projects as my educational introduction into the social science of science and technology decision- making. However, upon returning to the United States during one of the worst job markets in nearly 80 years, securing a position in science policy proved to be very difficult, and I was unemployed for five months. Ultimately, it took more than a year from the end of the Luce Scholarship to obtain my next science policy position with the American Society for Microbiology Congressional fellowship. This fellowship gave me the opportunity to work as the science and public health advisor to U.S. Senator Harry Reid. While there were significant challenges during my transition from the laboratory to science policy, those challenges made me tougher, more appreciative, and more prepared to move from working at the bench to working in the field of science policy. © 2011.},

Indeed, the field can be traced to early quantitative studies in the early 20th century. In the 1930s, it evolved to the "science of science." The publication of J.D. Bernal's Social Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay dormant until after World War II, when D.J.D. Price's books Science Since Babylon and Little Science, Big Science were published in 1961 and 1963. His role as the "Father of Scientometrics" is clearly evident by using the HistCite software to visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal Scientometrics on the growth of the field. Scientometrics owes its name to V.V. Nalimov, the author of Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who adapted the neologism for the journal. The primordial paper on citation indexing by Garfield which appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge between Bernal and Price. The timeline for the evolution of Scientometrics is demonstrated by a HistCite tabulation of the ranked citation index of the 100,000 references cited in the 3000 papers citing Price. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {It is a pleasure to read the contributions in this book, particularly since the importance of mathematics in biology has only slowly been realized over the past several decades by the biological research and education community. When I organized a Quantitative Sciences Curriculum for the Life Sciences Studentsworkshop in 1992 for leading practitioners of mathematical biology, there were few mathematics courses designed specifically for life science students and many bench biologists were unconvinced of a need for quantitative education. Although I did not know it at the time, several of the issues addressed in the 1992 and later workshops I organized had been the subject of the Cullowhee Conference on Training in Biomathematics held in 1961 atWestern Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, and attended by many leading mathematical biologists. Issues addressed at the Cullowhee Conference still reverberate today, including: “To what extent should mathematical courses given to biologists be different from those given to mathematicians?” (H.D. Landahl) and “Traditional biology courses lay far too much emphasis on the direct acquisition of information. Insufficient attention is given to the interpretation of facts or to the drawing of conclusions from observation and experience.” (J. G. Skellam). So have we learned anything in the fifty years since the Cullowhee Conference? This volume is a testament to a resounding YES! Many model programs have been developed, curricular material has been assembled, biologists are more attuned to the utility of quantitative approaches, and education research provides guidance on what works – learning not training, research participation not canned labs, active learning and peer collaboration not listening to lectures. We have moved beyond anecdotes to the science of science education. © 2013 by The Mathematical Association of America (Incorporated).},

Science studies should stop viewing itself as a quilt patch of subjects and reading itself as a creative mediation between knowledge and power. This is illustrated in terms of the emergence of Science Studies in India. Official India emphasized science policy as an extension of the Nation-State. Science studies arose as a response to science policy questioning the social contract between Science and State in India. Science studies emerged as a part of civil society after the Emergency of 1975 and among social movements rather than as a professionalized academic subject. In attempting to create an identity, science studies moved across four axis of possibility: the science of science, interdisciplinary science, transscience and alternative science. The second part of the paper links science studies to the democratic imagination. It argues that the citizen must be seen as a scientist, a person of knowledge not merely as a consumer and voter. The citizen thus becomes a trustee of local, defeated and marginal forms of knowledge. Its real role is in enhancing the democratic imagination, providing methodologies of conflict resolution and plural frameworks of knowledge for cognitive justice, thus emerging as a site for dissenting imaginations against the emerging global regime. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The undoubted priority of home science in this field, especially at the first stage of the fifty-year development of the modern theory, is stressed. Along with this, the lack of progress in solving, according to modern requirements, number of problems associated with the splitting of theoretical directions and the coordination, integration, and connection between theory and practice is stated. The possibility of solving problems of an adaptive controller on the basis of principles recently developed is stressed. An approximate theory and algorithmic facilities are presented. A revival of science of science in the field of automatic and automated systems of control by efforts of scientists-professional in this area themselves is recommended.},

The marginal costs of improving one's share are increasing over time. Countries differ considerably in terms of the efficiency of turning (financial) input into bibliometrically measurable output. Both funding schemes and disciplinary portfolios differ among countries. A price per paper can nevertheless be estimated. The percentages of GDP spent on academic research in different nations are significantly correlated to historical contingencies such as the percentage of researchers in the population.

It then introduces two infrastructures: (1) the Scholarly Database (SDB) (http://sdb.slis.indiana.edu), which provides free online access to 22 million scholarly records-papers, patents, and funding awards which can be cross-searched and downloaded as dumps, and (2) Scientometrics-relevant plug-ins of the open-source Network Workbench (NWB) Tool (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu). The utility of these infrastructures is then exemplarily demonstrated in three studies: a comparison of the funding portfolios and co-investigator networks of different universities, an examination of paper-citation and co-author networks of major network science researchers, and an analysis of topic bursts in streams of text. The article concludes with a discussion of related work that aims to provide practically useful and theoretically grounded cyberinfrastructure in support of computational scientometrics research, education and practice. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Research on learning science in informal settings and the formal (sometimes experimental) study of learning in classrooms or psychological laboratories tend to be separate domains, even drawing on different theories and methods. These differences make it difficult to compare knowing and learning observed in one paradigm/context with those observed in the other. Even more interestingly, the scientists studying science learning rarely consider their own learning in relation to the phenomena they study. A dialectical, reflexive approach to learning, however, would theorize the movement of an educational science (its learning and development) as a special and general case-subject matter and method-of the phenomenon of learning (in/of) science. In the dialectical approach to the study of science learning, therefore, subject matter, method, and theory fall together. This allows for a perspective in which not only disparate fields of study-school science learning and learning in everyday life-are integrated but also where the progress in the science of science learning coincides with its topic. Following the articulation of a contradictory situation on comparing learning in different settings, I describe the dialectical approach. As a way of providing a concrete example, I then trace the historical movement of my own research group as it simultaneously and alternately studied science learning in formal and informal settings. I conclude by recommending cultural-historical, dialectical approaches to learning and interaction analysis as a context for fruitful interdisciplinary research on science learning within and across different settings. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The unit was designed to help students learn Western science by building bridges between their traditional practices and beliefs on selected health-related matters and conventional science concepts. Students' responses to a summative test were analysed qualitatively by a process of coding and categorising. The results indicated, firstly, that students did not necessarily show that they had learned conventional science when personalised tasks were associated with contextualised stimuli. Secondly, students' responses provided evidence of parallel collateral learning. These findings were deliberately explored during a second research cycle. The initial findings were corroborated. In addition, examples of dependent and secured collateral learning emerged. There are implications for assessment policy and for further research to develop a science of science within the Caribbean. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Examples of each are described in this chapter. The methods used to evaluate TR constitute their own independent field of research, representing the formal study of how to encourage scientific research-to-practice or the 'science of science'.

	abstract = {Understanding how institutional changes within academia may affect the overall potential of science requires a better quantitative representation of how careers evolve over time. Because knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the annual production n i(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic "tent-shaped" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration radius and team efficiency.},

	abstract = {In Japanese pharmaceutical community, there seems to be a lack of "Science of Science" and "Research on Research" which are to utilize unit sciences and research for the benefit of human being. In other words, pharmaceutical people in Japan should have much more pharmaceutical philosophy. The late Professor Komei Miyaki, founder Editor-in-Chief of FARUMASHIA, the monthly membership magazine of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, under whom I worked as one of editorial board members, taught me that scientists should have their own philosophy of their sciences. Such a pharmaceutical philosophy as mentioned above should be established on the basis of complete separation of medical profession between doctors and pharmacists, which form the most important and necessary issue in safety assurance for patients with the complete zero defect (ZD action), as there is a long history for that in Europe since the separation was completed by King Friedrich II in 1240. Therefore, we have to learn the social status of European/American pharmacist practitioners who are the great No. 1 among all the professions. European pharmacists guarantee the safety of every chemical used for human body and pets, such as medicines, cosmetics, foods, tooth stuffs and so on. Regarding the pharmaceutical sciences in Japan also there seems to be a lack of pharmaceutical philosophy, as pharmaceutical scientists have no identity in research object that may be similar to basic scientists who are non-pharmacy graduates. Japanese sciences generally have developed along the lines of the Western model, reaching the current high level. We now not only should receive profits from the outside but also should embark on a mission to support pharmaceutical sciences throughout the world, especially Asian courtiers. At the present, we do not seem to be fulfilling our mission to do that, even though general activity includes significant international exchange. We have to make much more effort for international contribution/participation. For that, the most important and necessary issue is to make change in fundamental sense in Japanese pharmaceutical community, though an internationalization of technological issues is usually taken into consideration. In this connection, regarding the new drug development, we must have a change in the sense to establish pharmaceutical philosophy and jump up in conception from the existing one. Based on the above mentioned pharmaceutical philosophy, seven star pharmacists should be educated as described in 2000 FIP Statement of Policy: Good Pharmacy Education Practice, who could be a (1) care giver; (2) decision maker; (3) communicator; (4)leader; (5) manager; (6) life-long learner; (7)teacher. © 2003 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.},

	abstract = {Engaged scholarship is an intellectual movement sweeping across higher education, not only in the social and behavioral sciences but also in fields of natural science and engineering. It is predicated on the idea that major advances in knowledge will transpire when scholars, while pursuing their research interests, also consider addressing the core problems confronting society. For a workable engaged agenda in science and technology studies, one that informs scholarship as well as shapes practice and policy, the traditional terms of engagement must be renegotiated to be more open and mutual than has historically characterized the nature of inquiry in this field. At the same time, it is essential to protect individual privacy and preserve government confidentiality. Yet there is a scientific possibility for and benefit to introducing more collaborative and deliberative research approaches between scholar and subject in ways that will not violate these first-order ethics. To make the case, this article discusses the possibilities and perils of engaged science and technology scholarship by drawing on our own recent experiences to conduct and apply STS research while embedded in the National Science Foundation. Brief accounts of these experiences reveal the opportunities as well as the challenges of engaged scholarship. They also provide lessons for those fellow travelers who might follow the authors to this or other like host organizations with ambitions of increasing fundamental knowledge about and applying research to the policies, programs, and decisions of the scientific enterprise. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This article offers a brief overview of Bourdieu's framework, placing it in the context of dominant trends in Science and Technology Studies. Bourdieu provides an excellent justification for the project of the sociology of science, and some starting points for analysis. However, his framework suffers from his commitment to a vague evolutionary epistemology, and from his correlative and surprising neglect of science's habituses, with their particular practices, boundaries, and political economies. To be productive, Bourdieu's sociology of science would have to abandon its narrow rationalism and embrace the material complexity of the sciences. © The Author(s) 2011.},

No quantitative model to date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of endogenous processes, such as social collaborations, and exogenous events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration network. We find that this social model can account for a number of stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars, and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science. While several "science of science" theories exist, this is the first account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis of empirical data.},

At the same time, he also proposed to have effectively countered any relativistic views of science. In this article, I contend that Bourdieu’s project to develop an argument against cognitive relativism nevertheless fell short of its goal, owing to his confusion between consensus and absolute truth. It is absolute truth that is the opposite of relativism, not consensus. In addition, Bourdieu’s project fails in its attempt to refute relativism on empirical grounds. An empirical argument has only limited value as an argument against cognitive relativism. Moreover, Bourdieu’s overly sharp distinction between natural-scientific and social scientific research, if consistently followed, carries the risk of throwing sociology of science back into a Mannheimian sociology-of-knowledge mould. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

	abstract = {In recent years scholars have begun to apply perspectives of the sociology of scientific knowledge to technology. At the same time, there has been much concern about how to deal, methodologically, with the issue of reflexivity in sociological (and historical) studies of science. This paper considers implications of the reflexivity issue for sociological and historical accounts of technology. Drawing on characterizations of technology (mainly by its historians), the paper develops several senses in which technology is conceived to differ significantly from science. Accordingly, assumptions and approaches, contexts and expectations associated with the sociology of scientific knowledge may be inappropriate to the study of technology. These differences can be used to gain insights into the reflexivity question. If, as we have done in science, we look to the activity we study for guidance about how to study it, we may find technology to warrant a different conception of the location and purposes of its analysts than does science - a conception of the studier not as an isolated knower, but as a socially and politically involved co-creator. In line with recent suggestions of Sal Restivo and Bruno Latour, our activity as STS scholars might then better be characterized as a technology of technology (or science), rather than as a science of science (or technology). © 1992, SAGE Publications.

Z is aimed at correcting the potentially excessive penalty made by h on a scientist's highly cited papers, because for the majority of scientists analyzed, we find the excess citation fraction (C-h2)/C to be distributed closely around the value 0.75, meaning that 75% of the author's impact is neglected. Additionally, Z is less sensitive to local changes in a scientist's citation profile, namely perturbations which increase h while only marginally affecting C. Using real career data for 476 physicists careers and 488 biologist careers, we analyze both the distribution of Z and the rank stability of Z with respect to the Hirsch index h and the Egghe index g. We analyze careers distributed across a wide range of total impact, including top-cited physicists and biologists for benchmark comparison. In practice, the Z-index requires the same information needed to calculate h and could be effortlessly incorporated within career profile databases, such as Google Scholar and ResearcherID. Because Z incorporates information from the entire publication profile while being more robust than h and g to local perturbations, we argue that Z is better suited for ranking comparisons in academic decision-making scenarios comprising a large number of scientists. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In library and information science, LSBS is best remembered for its model of the exponential growth of scientific literature. Recent scientometric work has demonstrated that other mathematical models may prove a better fit to data on the actual growth of the literature in various fields; of these alternatives, the power model is most commonly invoked as an all-purpose descriptor of growth processes in electronic communication systems such as the Web.

	abstract = {Introduction From Sociologie de l'Algérie (Bourdieu 1958) to Pascalian Meditations (Bourdieu 2000a) and Science of Science and Reflexivity (Bourdieu 2004b) the notion of reflexivity is both at the origin and the heart of Pierre Bourdieu's work. As a methodological concept, reflexivity occupies a central role in the evolution of his work, not to say a defining one if it is to be understood within the intellectual field: Bourdieu has been insistently pointing at the possibility of a unified political economy of practice, and especially of symbolic power that fuses structural and phenomenologically-inspired approaches into a coherent, epistemologically grounded, mode of social enquiry of universal applicability … but one that is highly distinctive in that it explicitly encompasses the activity of the social analyst who sets out to offer accounts of the practice of others. (Wacquant, in Bourdieu & Wacquant 1989d: 26–7) A concept is defined according to how it is understood and extended. As such, reflexivity in Bourdieu's intertwined empirical and theoretical work is the moving representation of an object through the constant (re)formulation-expression of its use and its meaning. This is accompanied by parallel illustrations of its practically-grounded scientific and epistemological relevance and significance (Bourdieu 1977b; 1988a; 1990c; 1994e; 1998c). Certain concepts gain in applicability through the extension of the way they may be understood and used – often at the cost of coherence. However, reflexivity, as defined in Bourdieu's work, has followed a different path as he has sought to explain and refine its meaning and its multiple applicability, not least in relation to its evolving environment. © Editorial matter and selection, 2008 Michael Grenfell.},

Next, three visual conceptualizations of science are discussed and compared. Each of them provides a framework for the comparison and combination of existing works, means to combine quantitative and qualitative data, and helps to operationalize and communicate theoretical concepts using empirical data.

	abstract = {The "social network analysis" aims at identifying the inner relationships a given social group or entity is defined by. Methodologically applied with the intention to produce results about the social configuration that the researcher himself/herself is part of, such an empirical task can be interpreted in terms of the principles of reflexivity in social science as they are advocated by the work of Pierre Bourdieu: empirical work therefore follows the epistemological interest to reveal the conditions that covertly and unconsciously structure the work and the interest itself, thus enabling the researcher to gain knowledge about the influences and effects constituting the process of research. In this essay we argue that the social network analysis by STEINBRINK et al. (2010 and in this issue) implies similarities to those principles of science of scientific work and therefore to the work of Pierre Bourdieu on the scientific field with its focus on structuring power relations and the role and positionality of the (researching) subject within this specific social field. By following this we show that the analysis of quality and strength of social relations also implies an analysis of the power structures in the given sample. Moreover, a correlation of the socio-analytical theories of Pierre Bourdieu with the empirical tools of the social network analysis has to include further aspects (e.g. the limits of the field or the pathways of the subjects) to understand the social embeddedness of the researched network in the social space. We thus focus with our "re-reading" of the discussed study on the following two major aspects: (a) the project's proximity to Bourdieus principles of reflexivity in and about social science and (b) the potential of an analysis of the intrinsic power relations, which is in our view brought forth by the discussed study. Building on those aspects we argue for an invitation to the manifold practice of "science of science and reflexivity" (BOURDIEU 2004b) within Human Geography.},

The program was established at NSF in 2005 in response to a call from Dr. John Marburger III, then science advisor to the U. S. President, for a "science" of science policy. As of January 2011, it has co-funded 162 awards that aim to develop, improve, and expand data, analytical tools, and models that can be directly applied in the science policy decision making process. The long-term goals of the SciSIP program are to provide a scientifically rigorous and quantitative basis for science policy and to establish an international community of practice. The program has an active listserv that, as of January 2011, has almost 700 members from academia, government, and industry. This study analyzed all SciSIP awards (through January 2011) to identify existing collaboration networks and co-funding relations between SciSIP and other areas of science. In addition, listserv data was downloaded and analyzed to derive complementary discourse information. Key results include evidence of rich diversity in communication and funding networks and effective strategies for interlinking researcher and science policy makers, prompting discussion, and resource sharing. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Recent science of science research shows that scientific impact measures for journals and individual articles have quantifiable regularities across both time and discipline. However, little is known about the scientific impact distribution at the scale of an individual scientist. We analyze the aggregate production and impact using the rank-citation profile c i(r) of 200 distinguished professors and 100 assistant professors. For the entire range of paper rank r, we fit each c i(r) to a common distribution function. Since two scientists with equivalent Hirsch h-index can have significantly different c i(r) profiles, our results demonstrate the utility of the β i scaling parameter in conjunction with h i for quantifying individual publication impact. We show that the total number of citations C i tallied from a scientist's N i papers scales as C i∼h 1 i +β i. Such statistical regularities in the input-output patterns of scientists can be used as benchmarks for theoretical models of career progress.},

	abstract = {This paper articulates a citation-based approach to science policy evaluation and employs that approach to investigate the impact of the United States' 2001 policy regarding the federal funding of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research. We evaluate the impact of the policy on the level of U.S. hESC research, the U.S. position at the knowledge frontier, and the strategic response of U.S. scientists. Consistent with recent research on the science of science and innovation policy, we employ a difference-in-differences approach using bibliometric data with the aim of analyzing the causal impact of the policy on cumulative research. Our estimates suggest that in the aftermath of the 2001 policy, U.S. production of hESC research lagged 35 to 40 percent behind anticipated levels. However, this relative decline was largely concentrated in the years 2001 to 2003 and ameliorated over time. The rebound in U.S. hESC research after 2003 was driven by contributions by researchers at elite U.S. institutions and U.S. researchers who collaborated with international partners. The results suggest that scientists respond strategically to research funding restrictions and that modest science policy shifts can have a significant influence on the within-country composition of research and the pattern of global research collaboration. © 2012 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

This paper discusses the challenges of this 'BIG science of science' - Also called 'computational scientometrics' research - in terms of data access, algorithm scalability, repeatability, as well as result communication and interpretation. It then introduces two infrastructures: (1) the Scholarly Database (SDB) (http://sdb.slis.indiana.edu), which provides free online access to 20 million scholarly records - papers, patents, and funding awards which can be cross-searched and downloaded as dumps, and (2) Scientometrics-relevant plug-ins of the open-source Network Workbench (NWB) Tool (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu). The utility of these infrastructures is then exemplarily demonstrated in three studies: A comparison of the funding portfolios and co-investigator networks of different universities, an examination of paper-citation and co-author networks of major network science researchers, and an analysis of topic bursts in streams of text. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work that aims to provide practically useful and theoretically grounded cyberinfrastructure in support of computational scientometrics research, practice, and education.},

As a methodological concept, reflexivity occupies a central role in the evolution of his work, not to say a defining one if it is to be understood within the intellectual field: Bourdieu has been insistently pointing at the possibility of a unified political economy of practice, and especially of symbolic power that fuses structural and phenomenologically-inspired approaches into a coherent, epistemologically grounded, mode of social enquiry of universal applicability… but one that is highly distinctive in that it explicitly encompasses the activity of the social analyst who sets out to offer accounts of the practice of others. A concept is defined according to how it is understood and extended. As such, reflexivity in Bourdieu's intertwined empirical and theoretical work is the moving representation of an object through the constant (re)formulation/expression of its use and its meaning. This is accompanied by parallel illustrations of its practically-grounded scientific and epistemological relevance and significance (Bourdieu 1977b; 1990c; 1988a; 1994d; 1998c). Certain concepts gain in applicability through the extension of the way they may be understood and used - often at the cost of coherence. However, reflexivity, as defined in Bourdieu's work, has followed a different path as he has sought to explain and refine its meaning and its multiple applicability, not least in relation to its evolving environment. © Editorial matter and selection 2008, 2012 Michael Grenfell.},

Its exponent q is expressed as a function q(β) of the Renyi parameter β. The difference between the Renyi and Boltzmann-Shannon entropies (a modified Lyapunov functional ΛR) for the same power-law distribution is negative and as a function of β has a well-defined minimum at β* which remains within the narrow range from 1.5 to 3 when varying other characteristic parameters of any concrete systems. Relevant variations of the exponent q(β*) are found within the range 1-3.5. The same range of observable values of q is typical for the various applications where the power-law distribution takes place. It is known under the following names: `triangular or trapezoidal' (in physics and technics), `Gutenberg-Richter law' (in geophysics), `Zipf-Pareto law' (in economics and the humanities), `Lotka low' (in science of science), etc. As the negative ΛR indicates self-organization of the system, the negative minimum of ΛR corresponds to the most self-organized state. Thus, the comparison between the calculated range of variations of q(β*) and observable values of the exponent q testifies that the most self-organized states are as a rule realized regardless of the nature of a chaotic system.},

	abstract = {In scholarly debates, Ludwik Fleck's post-war paper 'Problemy naukoznawstwa [Problems of the Science of Science]', published in 1946, has been taken unanimously to illustrate the epistemology expounded in his monograph Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact. The paper has also been seen to support parts of the received view of Fleck, notably that he manufactured an anti-typhus vaccine while imprisoned in Buchenwald. However, a different narrative emerges when comparing Fleck's paper with other accounts, also published in 1946 and written by other prisoners alluded to by Fleck in his paper. The situation is further complicated by four papers, published in prestigious scientific journals between 1942 and 1945, by the German medical leader of the typhus studies accounted for by Fleck. In addition, a thus-far neglected paper by Fleck, published in 1946 and summarizing his observations on typhus, discloses his role in the Buchenwald studies. Despite the obvious difficulties with tracing the history behind these works, notably the one on Nazi science, the contention is that what was attempted in Buchenwald in the name of science amounted to pseudoscience. This conclusion is amply supported not only by the accounts given by Fleck's fellow prisoners, but also by his own post-war paper on typhus. Based on the above findings, it is suggested that the mythology about Fleck, established in the 1980s, has been accomplished by a selective reading of his papers and also that the role played by Fleck was more complex than has so far been contemplated. © SSS and SAGE Publications.},

These concepts are linked to three aspects of philosophy of science: logic of science, sociology of science, and ethics of science. The discussion focusses on the problematic relation between logic of science (philosophy of science in its central meaning) and sociology of science (or science of science). Further topics: (1) The distinction between the 'research form' and the 'theory form' of science. While analyses in the philosophy of science are first of all oriented towards the 'theory form' of science (under the concepts of the theory structure, theory dynamics, and theory explication), it is the 'research form' of science which will be of growing importance now. (2) Different approaches in the philosophy of science lead to different models of (scientific) rationality (the models of fallibilism, historism, and structuralism). (3) It is argued that philosophy and sociology of science are the area in which science may regain its status as a planning subject. © 1988 Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH.},

	abstract = {The respiratory system, a learning unit in biology, was taught to tenth grade (15- 16-year-old) pupils in a central urban school in order to analyse the learning of pupils at the concrete and formal cognitive stages. The six-week study included 102 pupils from three classes instructed by three biology teachers. Two tests were administered at the end of the learning unit: (a) a video-taped group test for assessing pupils’ mastery of formal reasoning skills; (b) a test designed to assess pupils’ achievements in biology at three cognitive levels: knowledge, application, and interpretation. Results show significant, positive correlations (r = from 0.57 to 0.77) between pupils’ cognitive stages and their biology achievements. Analysis of pupils’ answers disclosed that only pupils at the concrete cognitive stage made errors. The findings of this study support the Piagetian notion that learning may be subordinated to cognitive development. Findings also show that mastery of formal cognitive skills, although necessary, is not sufficient for high achievement in learning biology. pupils’ learning outcomes in each content area and to consider affective as well as cognitive factors. To understand the issue better, it was decided to assess the specific science course objectives which were achieved by pupils at different cognitive stages. This approach, used by Lawson and Renner (1975), Karplus et al. (1977), and Shayer (1978), contributed many insights to pupils’ difficulties in learning science. In their book, Towards a science of science teaching, Shayer and Adey (1981) claimed that many biological concepts are capable of some realization at almost any cognitive stage. But are pupils really capable of understanding every biological concept, regardless of their available reasoning strategies? The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between pupils’ cognitive stages and their biology learning outcomes. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

The calculation has been performed for the 16 countries with the greatest number of scientists. Czechoslovakia and Sweden have the highest concentration in a few cities, while the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany have the lowest concentration. In general, the degree of concentration varies inversely with the total number of scientists in a country, although there are exceptions. Part of the 'concentration effect' is due to a large number of scientists in one city, usually the capital. When the effect of the leading city is removed, the ranking of the countries changes sharply. Switzerland and Australia have the highest concentrations, and the United States and the United Kingdom have the lowest. Only a weak relationship is then shown between the total number of scientists and the degree of concentration. To remove the effect of population concentration, the cumulative proportion of scientists was divided by the cumulative proportion of population for the leading cities. This produced considerable change in the rankings by nation. The USSR and India have the highest proportions. Countries with low proportions included the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. Almost all countries had a greater degree of dispersion in 1972 as compared with 1967. The greatest changes towards dispersion were seen in India and the USSR. © 1977.},

In a one-dimensional model "cause" is a meaningful word, superlatives can be used, dichotomous thinking is realistic, with a resultant "zero-sum" mentality, and the "make a hypothesis-find a correlation" method makes sense. In the multidimensional framework these four characteristics are unsuitable, and instead a quite different set of questions arise as appropriate. This is illustrated on five examples taken from among currently interesting questions in the science of science. Following some remarks about simplicity and about the role and limitations of multiple regression analyses, it is concluded that, among other things, more purely phenomenological studies are needed to make progress in the science of science. © 1984 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

This determines one of the two dimensions of the two-dimensional space and provides an impetus for the development of the ethics of science. Today, the research impetus comes to the fore in works of another genre. This enables to regard the sphere of the ethics of science as the two-dimensional space formed by the axes of moral and cognitive judgments. Society today faces a crisis in science/society relations; therefore, there is the need for the ethics of science. It provides special knowledge about scientific activity and this type of knowledge distinguishes it from all other fields of the science of science. © 1989, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In his Histoire de science et des savants depuis deux sciecles, principles were established, science indicators outlined, interactions examined and mathematical methods applied to the study of a selected data set related to scientific development. In order to compare national and international scientific communities twenty standard factors were considered and national participation in international scientific societies was analysed for 14 European countries and the United States. De Candolle was the first to analyse mathematically the number, dynamics and national distribution of scientists in their professional organisations, the specialization and professionalization of scientists and characterized the scientific potential of different countries with the number of international science society members per inhabitant per period (1750-1884). The role of de Candolle as a forerunner of modern scientometrics and the science of science is revealed in a comparison of his work with recent trends. In the first five volumes of the journal Scientometrics 51 papers were identified dealing with topics related to those dealt with by de Candolle. © 1985 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

A description of a methodology for investigating basic assumptions and values of psychologists is included. Results show consistent and systematic differences between the groups in basic assumptions about psychology and scientific epistemology. The 2 groups did not differ in broad personal and sociocultural values, and some relationships between discipline-specific assumptions and values did emerge. It is argued that refinements in a value-laden conceptualization of science can be achieved through further research of this kind and that a psychology of science can contribute much to the interdisciplinary science of science.

	abstract = {The compilation of this literature survey was initiated more than a decade ago as a part of science-of-science bibliographies. The collected 150 studies and data sources are concerned with career migration, cross-disciplinary switching, international academic circulation and brain drain of physicists and in physics. The principal criterion for selection of items for listing was that they present fact-finding information on certain enduring aspect of the mobility process. Papers treating more ephemeral approaches are not included but a few conceptual pieces are the exceptions that prove the rule. Most entries are from the published literature. The arrangement of the bibliography is alphabetical by the first author, for each author a chronological order is used. Anonymous and edited works are filed under title. Cross-referencing will facilitate the use. Elementary techniques, such as following up the references in relevant documents, have been applied whenever possible and most documents have been scrutinized by actual reading. Papers on mobility in physics are rather widely dispersed in the literature, ranging from sociological analyses to science policy considerations. Since the information in numerous publications have important professional implications, the bibliography appears at the eve of the European Physical Society seminar on "Career outlook for physicists in Europe" in Erice, 25-27 June 1981. Though our selection of items does not go beyond physics proper, a few major documents on mobility in physical sciences are added. For a broader literature coverage on mobility in science see the bibliographies by R. T. Barth (1970), S. Dedijer and L. Svenningson (1967), B. M. Gupta (1977) and J. Vlachý (1979). A regular, comprehensive bibliographical service on behalf of the physics community would be desirable to be undertaken on a continuing basis and an appropriate institutional commitment. © 1981 Academia, Publishing House of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Reflecting on Moravcsik's paper and his assertion that a damaging dominant one-dimensionalism prevails within the science of science, one can draw the following conclusions. Firstly, the one-dimensionalism described by Moravcsik is a misrepresentation of a great deal of useful and valid "scientometric" research. This work is not so methodologically or theoretically naive as Moravcsik seeks to suggest, nor is it so uniform. Secondly, Moravcsik's assertion that there is little multidimensional work being carried out overlooks the considerable body of such research being published in the sociology of science. Thirdly, the sociology of science is but one sub-field of the science of science, and each such sub-field is characterized by its own sets of objectives and resource constraints. The nature of these objectives and constraints determines the relative suitability of particular methodologies and the optimal mix of methodologies. This in turn influences the relative frequency of adoption of those approaches which can be described as either "one-" or multidimensional. The result is that contrary to Moravcsik's assertions, a methodological pluralism already exists; a methodological pluralism which should be recognised as a natural consequence of the diversity of research objectives and constraints which characterize the science of science, as well as the wide range of disciplinary backgrounds of those who work within it. As the science of science has itself shown, discussion of cognitive content should not be totally divorced from consideration of social context. © 1984 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

The following are thought to be the main reasons: (i) How can the primitive notation "to be an element of" in set theory be given natural and reasonable meanings in applications ? (ii) Sets: what kind of collection of natural matters is a set ? In the rest of this paper a variety of applications and real models of a generalized general systems theory are introduced, where the generalized general systems theory was thought by some experts as a theory in a right track for the development of general systems theory. The following applications and models are listed in this paper: (i) Applications in epistemology. (ii) Application in the morphology of polymers. (iii) A model of genetics. (iv) A model of the development of a cultural entity. © 1988.},

Some disciplines, such as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy, have numerous noteworthy compendia and even specialized journals where papers on the history of these sciences can be published. The situation in geophysics, meteorology, and other subdivisions of the geosciences is far less favorable. This neglect is an outcome of a dogma of autonomy that is essentially oriented toward progress in understanding, without much reference to historical developments. But even the geoscientists cannot ignore that the phenomenon ‘science’ must be viewed in the context of sociological processes. In the initial stages, sociologists and some philosophers, in the context of the general theory of perception, began research into the development of scientific thought, but the geoscientists and other natural scientists contributed very little. It has since become clear that research on these topics requires historical assessment and more insight. The development of the ‘science of science’ is directed toward understanding and explanation of the complex human involvement in science, not only in the sense of theorizing about the scientific processes but also in sociological, political, and historical context [Kuhn, 1973; Burrichter, 1979; Sandkühler and Plath, 1979.] ©1981.

The movements known as operationism, logical positivism, and physicalism are considered in detail, and the implications of these movements, especially operationism, for psychology are emphasized. Three features of this embryonic science of science are said to be especially prominent: (1) "The rational and empirical elements in science are disentangled and then reassembled according to a straightforward, workable plan." (2) "It is proposed that in our study of the science-maker we begin with the products of his activity--his finished propositions--rather than with his 'experiences' or any other phase of his earlier behavior." (3) The science of science must go to psychology, particularly behavioristic psychology, for an answer to many of its problems. A "case study of language" and a note on the hypothetico-deductive method are included in appendices. An annotated bibliography of 67 titles is appended.
