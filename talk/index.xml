      <description>Earth Observation &amp;amp; Artificial Intelligence solutions for climate change challenges   Earth Observation (EO) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are playing a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As the global climate crisis intensifies, there is an increasing need for accurate and timely information to understand, monitor, and mitigate the impacts of climate change on our planet. EO and AI technologies, when combined, offer powerful tools to gather, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data, enabling us to make informed decisions and take effective actions.</description>

      <description>Towards Spatial Data Science   Since 2011, Professor Alfred Stein and colleagues - in collaboration with Elsevier - have been organizing this series of Spatial Statistics conferences every 2 years. The 5th Spatial Statistics conference is held in Sitges, Spain. The conference focus: Towards Spatial Data Science. Covering a wide conference themes:
  Space-time statistics, e.g. geostatistics, point patterns, estimation methods, large dimensions New spatial data sources, e.g. social media, Google, citizen science, crowd source maps Stochastic geometry, tesselation, point processes, random sets Causal statistical modeling Trajectory/movement modeling Predictive modelling Spatial data quality and uncertainty   Space-Time Stochastic Rainfall Fields for Uncertainty Propagation   On 12 July, I gave a talk on application of space-time stocastic rainfall fields and downscaling for uncertainty propagation.</description>

      <title>Towards an uncertainty propagation framework in urban drainage system modelling</title>

      <description>Most urban drainage models do not pay attention to uncertainty propagation. In particular, commercial software packages as used in engineering practice typically ignore uncertainties due to lack of user-friendly software implementations and tools. However, uncertainties can be substantial and ignoring these may affect decision making. In particular, end users should be aware of uncertainties so that they can take more robust decisions. Thus, research into uncertainty propagation in urban drainage modelling and development of operational systems that can trace the propagation of uncertainties is needed.</description>
